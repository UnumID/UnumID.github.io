For each credential, include a type and data in accordance with one of our data schemas.  Ask Us for New Schemas If Needed If we don't have a data schema that suits your needs, email us at Support@Verified.Inc) and we'll make one for you.  For example, if you have a verified Social Security Number (SSN) and a full name for a user, you can issue them credentials.

With standard issuance, you issue an ID card to a user, and that's it. There are no further steps.  But you can also implement partner issuance to enable affiliate offers for partner brands. With partner issuance, you issue an ID card to a user, and then you redirect them to a 1-Click Signup flow for the partner brand. That way, the user can immediately use their ID card to sign up for the partner, and you immediately earn revenue!  This allows you to present users with affiliate offers that convert with 1-click, meaning far higher conversion for partners and far more revenue for you.  Brands in our network that have implemented partner issuance have seen on average 7.9x higher conversion rates compared with normal affiliate offers.

In this case, it is a reference to another schema. This is how we define composite credential schemas.  note It's important to note that each of these credentials inside FullNameCredential are single attribute atomic credentials, so you are able to request individually.

But you can still use the 1ClickUuid to check if the user verified their phone number or email address.  Definitions An identifier is a phone number or email address the user uses to verify for 1-Click Signup. identifierType is the type of identifier (phone or email). A credential is a piece of data the user shares (e.g. birth date or SSN). A credential type is a string indicating the type of a credential (e.g. SsnCredential or FirstNameCredential). It's formatted in PascalCase and always includes the word Credential at the end. shortenedCredentialType is the shortened credential type in camelCase. The shortened credential type is just the type without the word Credential (e.g. birthDate or ssn). For subcredentials of a composite credential, it includes the shortened credential type of its parent credential(s) (e.g. fullName.firstName). Accepted Values Currently, accepted values for shortenedCredentialType are: emailfullName.firstNamefullName.middleNamefullName.lastNamebirthDateaddress.line1address.line2address.cityaddress.stateaddress.zipCodeaddress.countryssn Data in this context means identity information about a user (e.g. their name, contact information, etc.)Metadata in this context means any additional data that's not identity information about a user (e.g. the verification method for their identity information). metadataType is the type of metadata. Accepted Values Currently, possible values for metadataType are: id: unique identifier for a credential UUIDApplies only to credentials verificationMethod: how an identifier or credential was verified enum: &quot;phone_carrier&quot;, &quot;otp&quot;, &quot;self_attested&quot;, or nullApplies to both identifiers and credentials status: status of a credential enum: &quot;valid&quot; or &quot;revoked&quot;Applies only to credentials issuerUuid: brand that issued a credential UUIDApplies only to credentials issuanceDate: date a credential was issued Unix timestampApplies only to credentials expirationDate: date a credential expires Unix timestampApplies only to credentials  Response Body​  1-Click Response { &quot;identifiers&quot;: { [identifierType: string]: string }, &quot;credentials&quot;: { [shortenedCredentialType: string]: string }, &quot;metadata&quot;: { &quot;identifiers&quot;: { [identifierType: string]: { [metadataType: string]: string } }, &quot;credentials&quot;: { [shortenedCredentialType: string]: { [metadataType: string]: string } } } }   tip One particularly valuable piece of metadata is verificationMethod, which describes how the credential (piece of user data) was verified.

Because it is marked as mandatory, it only matches if the user has a credential. SnnCredential { &quot;type&quot;: &quot;SsnCredential&quot;, &quot;issuers&quot;: [], &quot;mandatory&quot;: &quot;yes&quot; } FullNameCredential is a &quot;composite credential&quot; and therefore has 2 sub-credentials¹: FirstNameCredential, LastNameCredential. Because it is marked as mandatory, and it has no children attribute, it only matches if the user has a credential with all sub-credentials.

StateCredential and CountryCredential are mandatory and therefore the user must have a credential of each type to match. ZipCodeCredential is optional and therefore the user may or may not have a credential of type to match.
