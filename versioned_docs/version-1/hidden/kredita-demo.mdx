import Tip from '@site/src/components/Tip';

The open source Kredita demos demonstrate an example implementation of the [1-Click IDV](https://www.verified.inc/1-click) offering. It is an application for a fictional customer, Kredita, which accepts Verified Inc. <Tip type="credential">credentials</Tip> issued by Hooli.

Additional information on how to implement can be found and in the API's [check user credentials](/api-overview#check-user-credentials) and [get shared credentials](/api-overview#get-shared-credentials) documentation sections.

## Web Demo
The live Kredita web application demo can be found [here](https://kredita-web.demo.sandbox-verifiedinc.com/login). Its open source code can be found on [Github](https://github.com/VerifiedInc/Kredita-Demo-Web). 

In order to best appreciate the demo, it is recommended to use the same email that you used from the [Hooli](/hooli-demo) demo so you can experience the 1-Click signup flow.
