Regulations require that users give informed consent, so you must our legal language where you start the 1-Click Signup flow. It can be included alongside or as part of other legal language you already use, but it must be displayed to the user and not just included in terms you link out to.

Use this language:

> By `{taking this action}`, you agree to {props.agreeToAction} for 1-Click Signup at `{Brand Name}` and other supported sites, and you agree to Verified's [Terms of Use](https://verified.inc/legal#terms-of-use).

- **Replace `{taking this action}` with the action the user will take to start 1-Click Signup.** For example:
    - If you use a form with a phone number input that autosubmits, we recommend using "entering your phone number".
    - If you use a Continue button, we recommend using "clicking Continue".
- **Replace `{Brand Name}` with your brand name.**
- **Link "Terms of Use" to https://verified.inc/legal#terms-of-use and make it a different color than the rest of the text, underlined, or both** (so the user knows it's a link).
