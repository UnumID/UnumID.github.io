<Admonition type="tip">
    <b>If you have the user's birth date, include that in the request body</b> along with the phone number. You'll see later in this integration guide that, if we can't source data for the user based on just their phone number, you'll need to ask the user for their birth date then. If for any reason you already have the user's birth date, you should include it in the API call here so no further call will be necessary.
