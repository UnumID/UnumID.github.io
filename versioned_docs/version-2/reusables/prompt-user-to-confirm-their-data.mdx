Depending on your use case, you may need to display the user's data to them and have them confirm it's correct.

<Admonition type="warning">
    If you're subject to financial data regulations — for example, if you're opening a financial account for a user with the data we return about them — you are **required** to have the user confirm their data. 
</Admonition>


You only need to display the user's [**credential**](/v2/types#credentials) data (their identity data) to them. You don't need to display any [**metadata**](/v2/types#metadata), though you can choose to if it's relevant.

Depending on your use case, you may want to allow the user to edit some or all data points. The upside is that it allows the user to correct any inaccuracies. The downside is that user modifications won't be verified data and may make fraud more likely.

<Admonition type="warning" title="Mask Social Security Numbers">
    If you received a user's full Social Security Number, mask the first 5 digits to ensure the full number stays private. If you allow the user to edit the number, clear the entire value (so they don't just edit the last 4 digits).
</Admonition>

In general, we recommend you do this for two reasons:
1. **Transparency:** By displaying the user's data to them, you ensure they're aware of what data you've received about them.
2. **Accuracy:** Although Verified provides _very_ high quality data, we can never guarantee all data will be perfectly accurate. By having the user confirm their data, you can better avoid inaccuracies. Depending on your use case, you may want to give the user the ability to edit their data.

However, for some use cases, it may be appropriate and make more sense to not display the user's data to them or have them confirm it. Choose the approach that's best for your use case, but make sure it's compliant with regulations.

<Admonition type="info" title="Possible Inaccuracies">
    The most common inaccuracy is an outdated address. We keep user addresses up to date as much as possible, but if the user has moved very recently, we may not yet have their current address.

    Less commonly, a user may have an outdated name, if they've recently had it legally changed and we haven't yet updated it.

    Some data points, like date of birth and SSN, should never change, but it's still possible (in very rare cases) for these to be inaccurate. So, if having perfectly accurate data is crucial for your use case, we recommend that you have users confirm it.
