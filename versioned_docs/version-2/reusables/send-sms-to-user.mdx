Send an SMS to the user with `code` from the response body of `POST /1-click`.

We recommend using this language, where `{Brand Name}` is your brand name:

> Enter this code to verify for `{Brand Name}`: `code`

For example:

> Enter this code to verify for Hooli: 123456

<Admonition type="warning">
    **Our [test user](/v2/environments#test-user)'s phone numbers aren't valid phone numbers, so sending SMS to them won't work.** You can simulate the SMS step by using the [static verification code](/v2/environments#test-user) (`111111`), but we recommend instead using your own phone number(s) for testing, so you can send yourself real SMS messages.
