<Admonition type="note">
    This step is necessary if <a href={props.stepLink}>{props.stepName}</a> doesn't succeed, which means we need more information (the user's birth date) to uniquely identify the user. The response body of `POST /1-click` will be an [error](./errors) with error code [`OCE011`](./errors#oce011). The maximum times a `birthDate` can be submitted is 3 per phone number. If the limit is reached, the response body will be an [error](./errors) with error code [`OCE019`](./errors#oce019).

    Note that this error code, which is Verified specific, is `data.errorCode` in the error object, _not_ `code` (which is a standard HTTP response status code).
