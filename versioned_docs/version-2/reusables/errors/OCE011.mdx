  message='Additional information is required to source data for user: {inputs}'
  description='Additional information is required to source data for user: `{inputs}`'
>
  #### `OCE011`
</ErrorDisplay>

Occurs when additional information (typically birth date) is required to fetch user credentials during the 1-Click flow.

:::tip Example

1. A user initiates 1-Click with only a phone number
2. The system determines it needs the user's birth date to fetch their credentials
3. The user will need to provide their birth date to proceed

:::

:::info
The `{inputs}` included in `message` is a comma separated list of required additional information. Generally, it's a single item: `birthDate`.
