{/* The `{inputs}` included in `message` is a comma separated list of additional information, generally `birthDate, ssn4`. It always indicates an **inclusive OR:** for example, `birthDate, ssn4` indicates that you can pass `birthDate`, `ssn4`, or both. */}

The `{inputs}` included in `message` is a comma separated list of additional information, generally just `birthDate`. It always indicates an **inclusive OR:** that is, you can pass one or more of the additional inputs.

{/* We recommend using `birthDate` over `ssn4` when possible because: 
1. Users are typically more comfortable providing their birthday.
2. Some users will have an autofill option for birthday from their browser or OS.
3. Everyone has a birthday, but not everyone has an SSN. */}
