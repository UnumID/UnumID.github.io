**1-Click Signup is the _fastest_ way to sign up new users.** With just a phone number (and sometimes a birth date), in less than 10 seconds, a user can share their verified data, including:
- Full Name
- Email(s)
- Phone(s)
- Address(es)
- Date of Birth
- Social Security Number
- _... and more! See [credentials](./types#credentials) for details_

**We can source this verified data for 95% of US adults (253M consumers).** The data is extremely high quality because it comes from phone carriers, credit bureaus, and other trusted providers who are often required by law to perform strong identity verification (Know Your Customer) on their users.
