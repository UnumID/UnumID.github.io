## Setup


### 1. Log into Dashboard.

<SetupLoginToDashboard/>

---


### 2. Determine integration type.

On the Brand Details page in the Dashboard, you can configure settings for your brand. 

The most important brand setting is **integration type,** which affects how you implement 1-Click Signup. 

:::tip
You can always start with one integration type and change it later.
:::

There are three options for integration type:

| Integration Type | User Interface | Phone Verification | Description | Best If... |
|:---------------- |:------------ |:--------------------------- |:----------- | :------- |
| **Hosted** | Hosted by Verified | Hosted by Verified | Use Verified's UI and Verified's verification code | You want the quickest implementation |
| **Semi-Hosted** | Hosted by You | Hosted by Verified | Use your own UI but Verified's verification code | You _don't_ already verify users' phone numbers |
| **Non-Hosted** <Chip label="Recommended" variant="outlined" size="small" color="primary"/> | Hosted by You | Hosted by You | Use your own UI and your own verification code | You _do_ already verify users' phone numbers |

:::tip We Recommend Non-Hosted
**Non-Hosted** is the most common integration type and the one we recommend. It allows you to make 1 API call and receive user data directly in the response body. It's the simplest way to integrate 1-Click Signup, as long as you already verify user's phone numbers. If you don't already do this, Semi-Hosted or Hosted may be a better option. 
:::

Determining which option is best for you is simple. Just answer these questions:

#### a. Do you want to use Verified's UI or your own? 

_Using Verified's UI is the easiest option, but using your own UI is more white label. You can always start with Verified's UI — for example to quickly try out 1-Click Signup — and then switch to your own UI later._
    - Verified's UI → Select **Hosted** and go to [Integration](?integrationType=hosted#integration)
    - Your own UI → Continue to question b...

#### b. Do you want to use Verified's phone verification or your own? 

_If you don't already verify users' phone numbers, it's easiest to use Verified's phone verification. But if you already verify users' phone numbers and want to use your existing solution for that, you can use your own phone verification._
    - Verified's phone verification → Select **Semi-Hosted** and go to [Integration](?integrationType=semi-hosted#integration)
    - Your own phone verification → Select **Non-Hosted** and go to [Integration](?integrationType=non-hosted#integration)


---


### 3. Configure default credential requests.

:::note Definitions
- A [**credential**](/data#credentials) is a piece of identity data about a user (like a first name or address).
- A **credential request** is how you ask Verified for a particular credential. It encodes what type of data you're asking for, whether it's required or optional, whether multiple values should be returned, etc. See the [`CredentialRequest`](/types#credentialrequest) type for full details.
:::

Another important brand setting is **default credential requests**, which determines what user data Verified will try to source for you. 

When you create a new brand, the Dashboard starts you off with standard default credential requests to provide you with a helpful starting point. Edit these to reflect the user data you'd like Verified to source.

:::tip
The default credential requests are called default because they apply if you don't include the optional `credentialRequests` attribute in the request body of `POST /1-click` (which you call in step 2 of [Integration](#integration) below).

If you _do_ include `credentialRequests` in the request body of `POST /1-click`, they will override the default credential requests defined in the Dashboard. We don't recommend doing this unless your use case requires you to dynamically change credential requests on a per API call basis. _Note that if you include `credentialRequests`, it must be an array of [`CredentialRequest`](/types#credentialrequest) objects._

## Integration

<DevelopmentWorkAdmonition/>

<Tabs groupId="integrationType" queryString="integrationType">
<TabItem value="hosted" label="Hosted" default>
    <IntegrationTypeAdmonition option="Hosted"/>


    ### 1. Prompt user for phone number.

    To start 1-Click Signup for a user (using the Hosted integration type), you'll need their phone number.  

    We recommend using a form with a phone number input that automatically submits when the user enters 10 digits. _See our [Demo](https://1-click.demo.verified.inc?integrationType=hosted) for an example of this._

    <SupportedPhoneNumbersAdmonition/>

    **You'll also need to:**
    <ol type="a">
        <li>[**Include a "powered by Verified" graphic**](#a-include-a-powered-by-verified-graphic)</li>
        <li>[**Include Verified legal language**](#b-include-verified-legal-language)</li>
    </ol>

    Here's a full example:

    ![](/img/phone-number-input.png)
    *Hooli uses a phone number input, and they include a gray variant of the "powered by" graphic and Verified legal language.*


    #### a. Include "powered by Verified" graphic.

    <IncludePoweredByGraphic/>


    #### b. Include Verified legal language.

    <IncludeVerifiedLegalLanguage agreeToAction="receive an SMS to create a Verified account"/>

    ---
    

    ### 2. Call `POST /1-click`.

    Call [`POST /1-click`](./endpoints?integrationType=hosted#post-1-click) with the user's phone number. 

    <UseYourOwnPhoneNumberAdmonition/>
    
    The [response body](./endpoints?integrationType=hosted#post-1-click-response) will contain `url` and `code`, which you'll use in the following steps.

    ---


    ### 3. Send SMS to user.

    <SendSmsToUser/>

    ---


    ### 4. Redirect user.

    Redirect the user to `url` from the response body of `POST /1-click`. (If the user is in your mobile app, open a webview to `url`.)
    
    This `url` is a link to our web app, where we'll prompt the user to:
    <ol type="a">
        <li>Enter their verification code</li>
        <li>(if necessary) Enter their birth date</li>
        <li>Confirm their data and agree to share it with your brand</li>
    </ol>

    When the user has completed this, we'll redirect them back to you.

    ---


    ### 5. Parse `identityUuid` from URL.

    When we redirect the user back to you, we'll include on the redirect URL an `identityUuid` URL parameter, whose value is a UUID. 
    
    For example, if your redirect URL is `https://hooli.com/verified`, we will send the user to:
    ```json title="Redirect URL with identityUuid Parameter"
    https://hooli.com/verified?identityUuid=47e34f9c-a18b-4e67-a202-3f5389d06c08
    ```

    <Admonition type="info" title="What Redirect URL Will We Use?">
        We'll redirect the user to the **default redirect URL** set for your brand in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.verified.inc), unless you overrode that default by including `redirectUrl` in the request body of `POST /1-click`.
    </Admonition>

    Parse the value of the `identityUuid` URL parameter from the redirect URL. You'll use this UUID in the next step. (If the user is in your mobile app, you can now close the webview you opened in the previous step.)

    ---


    ### 6. Call `GET /1-click`.

    Call [`GET /1-click/{identityUuid}`](./endpoints?integrationType=hosted#get-1-click) with the value of the `identityUuid` URL parameter. 
    
    The [response body](./endpoints?integrationType=hosted#get-1-click-response) will be a [`1ClickEntity`](./types#1clickentity) (see this [example](./types#example-1clickentity)), which contains the user's data and metadata about it. You can use this data however you like to create a new account for the user!

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="semi-hosted" label="Semi-Hosted">
    <IntegrationTypeAdmonition option="Semi-Hosted"/>


    ### 1. Prompt user for phone number.

    To start 1-Click Signup for a user (using the Semi-Hosted integration type), you'll need their phone number.  

    We recommend using a form with a phone number input that automatically submits when the user enters 10 digits. _See our [Demo](https://1-click.demo.verified.inc?integrationType=semi-hosted) for an example of this._

    <SupportedPhoneNumbersAdmonition/>

    **You'll also need to:**
    <ol type="a">
        <li>[**Include a "powered by Verified" graphic**](#a-include-a-powered-by-verified-graphic)</li>
        <li>[**Include Verified legal language**](#b-include-verified-legal-language)</li>
    </ol>

    Here's a full example:

    ![](/img/phone-number-input.png)
    *Hooli uses a phone number input, and they include a gray variant of the "powered by" graphic and Verified legal language.*


    #### a. Include "powered by Verified" graphic.

    <IncludePoweredByGraphic/>


    #### b. Include Verified legal language.

    <IncludeVerifiedLegalLanguage agreeToAction="receive an SMS to create a Verified account"/>

    ---
    

    ### 2. Call `POST /1-click`.

    Call [`POST /1-click`](./endpoints?integrationType=semi-hosted#post-1-click) with the user's phone number.

    <UseYourOwnPhoneNumberAdmonition/>

    <IncludeBirthDateIfPossibleAdmonition/>
    
    The [response body](./endpoints?integrationType=semi-hosted#post-1-click-response) will contain `uuid` and `code`, which you'll use in the following steps.

    ---


    ### 3. Send SMS to user.

    <SendSmsToUser/>

    ---


    ### 4. Prompt user for verification code.

    We recommend using a form with a numeric input that automatically submits when the user enters 6 digits (because `code` has 6 digits).

    Let's call what the user inputs `userInput`. You'll use this in the next step.

    ---


    ### 5. Call `GET /1-click`.

    Call [`GET /1-click/{uuid}?{userInput}`](./endpoints?integrationType=semi-hosted#get-1-click) with `uuid` from the [response body of `POST /1-click`](./endpoints?integrationType=semi-hosted#post-1-click-response) and `userInput`.

    <UseUserInputAdmonition/>

    One of two things should happen:
    - **Success:** If we can source data based on just the phone number, the [response body](./endpoints?integrationType=semi-hosted#post-1-click-response) will contain a [`1ClickEntity`](./types#1clickentity) (see this [example](./types#example-1clickentity)), keyed on `identity`, that contains the user's data and metadata about it. In this case, continue to [step 8](#8-prompt-user-to-confirm-their-data).
    - **Error:** Otherwise, the response body will contain an [error](./errors) indicating that we need additional information (the user's birth date) to source data. In this case, continue to [step 6](#6-if-necessary-prompt-user-for-birth-date). The error will have error code [`OCE011`](./errors#oce011) and look like this:
    <ErrorExampleOce011/>

    ---


    ### 6. (if necessary) Prompt user for birth date.

    <WhenStepIsNecessaryAdmonition stepName="step 5" stepLink="#5-call-get-1-click"/>

    We recommend using a form with a numeric input (formatted as `MM/DD/YYYY` or similar) that automatically submits when the user enters 8 digits. _See our [Demo](https://1-click.demo.verified.inc?integrationType=semi-hosted) for an example of this._

    <BirthDateFormatAdmonition/>

    ---


    ### 7. (if necessary) Call `PATCH /1-click`.

    <WhenStepIsNecessaryAdmonition stepName="step 5" stepLink="#5-call-get-1-click"/>

    Call [`PATCH /1-click/{uuid}`](./endpoints?integrationType=semi-hosted#patch-1-click) with `uuid` from the [response body of `POST /1-click`](./endpoints?integrationType=semi-hosted#post-1-click-response).

    One of two things should happen:
    - **Success:** If we can source data based on the phone number and birth date, the [response body](./endpoints?integrationType=semi-hosted#patch-1-click-response) will be a [`1ClickEntity`](./types#1clickentity) (see this [example](./types#example-1clickentity)), which contains the user's data and metadata about it. In this case, continue to [step 8](#8-prompt-user-to-confirm-their-data).
    - **Error:** Otherwise, the response body will contain an [error](./errors) indicating that the birth date didn't match. In this case, return to [step 6](#6-if-necessary-prompt-user-for-birth-date) (prompt the user for birth date again, and then call `PATCH /1-click` again). The error will have error code [`OCE012`](./errors#oce012).

    ### 8. Prompt user to confirm their data.

    <PromptUserToConfirmTheirData/>

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="non-hosted" label="Non-Hosted">
    <IntegrationTypeAdmonition option="Non-Hosted"/>

    To start 1-Click Signup for a user (using the Non-Hosted integration type), you'll need their phone number, and you'll need to verify it using your own solution.

    <Admonition type="important">
        **The Non-Hosted integration type requires you to verify phone numbers with your own solution.** If you'd like to use ours, switch to the [Semi-Hosted](?integrationType=semi-hosted#integration) or [Hosted](?integrationType=hosted#integration) integration type.
    </Admonition>

    ### 1. Prompt user for phone number and verify it.

    You can do this however you like, as long as you verify the user's phone number with a one-time verification code at least 6 digits long.

    We recommend using a form with a phone number input that automatically submits when the user enters 10 digits. _See our [Demo](https://1-click.demo.verified.inc?integrationType=non-hosted) for an example of this._

    <SupportedPhoneNumbersAdmonition/>

    **You'll also need to:**
    <ol type="a">
        <li>[**Include a "powered by Verified" graphic**](#a-include-a-powered-by-verified-graphic)</li>
        <li>[**Include Verified legal language**](#b-include-verified-legal-language)</li>
    </ol>

    Here's a full example:

    ![](/img/phone-number-input.png)
    *Hooli uses a phone number input, and they include a gray variant of the "powered by" graphic and Verified legal language.*


    #### a. Include "powered by Verified" graphic.

    <IncludePoweredByGraphic/>


    #### b. Include Verified legal language.

    <IncludeVerifiedLegalLanguage agreeToAction="create a Verified account"/>

    ---


    ### 2. Call `POST /1-click` with phone number.

    Call [`POST /1-click`](./endpoints?integrationType=non-hosted#post-1-click) with the user's phone number.

    <Admonition type="danger" title="Recency Requirement">
        **You must call `POST /1-click` within 30 minutes of verifying the user's phone number ([step 1](?integrationType=non-hosted#1-prompt-user-for-phone-number-and-verify-it)).** This is an important anti-fraud measure.
    </Admonition>

    <Admonition type="tip">
        **For any phone number, in our [Sandbox](./environments#sandbox) environment, we'll return [mock data](./environments#mock-data).** You're welcome to use your own phone number(s) and/or our [test user](./environments#test-user)'s phone number. 
    </Admonition>

    <IncludeBirthDateIfPossibleAdmonition/>

    One of two things will happen:
    - **Success:** If we can source data based on just the phone number, the [response body](./endpoints?integrationType=non-hosted#post-1-click-response) will contain a [`1ClickEntity`](./types#1clickentity) (see this [example](./types#example-1clickentity)), keyed on `identity`, that contains the user's data and metadata about it. In this case, continue to [step 5](#5-prompt-user-to-confirm-their-data).
    - **Error:** Otherwise, the response body will contain an error indicating that we need additional information (the user's birth date) to source data. In this case, continue to [step 3](#3-if-necessary-prompt-user-for-birth-date). The error will have error code [`OCE011`](./errors#oce011) and look like this:
    <ErrorExampleOce011/>


    ### 3. (if necessary) Prompt user for birth date.

    <WhenStepIsNecessaryAdmonition stepName="step 2" stepLink="#2-call-post-1-click-with-phone-number"/>

    If [step 2](#2-call-post-1-click-with-phone-number) doesn't succeed, that means we need more information (the user's birth date) to ensure we retrieve data for only the correct user.

    We recommend using a form with a numeric input (formatted as `MM/DD/YYYY` or similar) that automatically submits when the user enters 8 digits. _See our [Demo](https://1-click.demo.verified.inc?integrationType=non-hosted) for an example of this._

    <BirthDateFormatAdmonition/>


    ### 4. (if necessary) Call `POST /1-click` with phone number and birth date.

    <WhenStepIsNecessaryAdmonition stepName="step 2" stepLink="#2-call-post-1-click-with-phone-number"/>

    Call [`POST /1-click`](./endpoints?integrationType=non-hosted#post-1-click) with the user's phone number and birth date.

    <SandboxBirthDateAdmonition/>
    <Admonition type="danger" title="Recency Requirement">

## Go Live!

When you're ready to go live, we will review your integration to see that:

<input type="checkbox" id="legal"/>
<label for="legal">**You've included a "powered by Verified" graphic and the Verified legal language.**</label>
<br/>
<input type="checkbox" id="sms"/>
<label for="sms">**You're properly verifying users' phone numbers.**</label>
<br/>
<input type="checkbox" id="testing"/>
<label for="testing">**Your 1-Click Signup flow is working end-to-end in Sandbox.**</label>
<br/>
<input type="checkbox" id="synced"/>
<label for="synced">**Your Sandbox brand settings (configured in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.verified.inc)) are synced to Production.**</label>
<br/>
<br/>

Once we've confirmed these items, we'll approve your integration for [Production](./environments#production), which will enable you to create Production API keys in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.verified.inc).

Just swap your Sandbox API key for a Production API key, and you'll be live with 1-Click Signup!


{/* ## User Experience

From the user's perspective, they:
1. Verify their phone number
2. See their verified data autofilled
3. Click to confirm

<Tabs groupId="integrationType" queryString="integrationType">

2. Send SMS to user with `code` and redirect user to `url`.
4. User agrees to share data in Wallet
5. We redirect user to brand with identityUuid
6. One of:
    1. (if brand using push option) We send data to brand’s webhook
    2. (if brand using pull option) Brand calls GET /1-click with identityUuid, and we return identity


## How to Implement

To enable 1-Click Signup, you'll need to:
- Verify the user's phone number (by sending an SMS)
