import Tip from '../../src/components/Tip';

The open source Hooli partner demo demonstrates an example implementation of issuing partner Verified Inc. digital identity cards to share with a specific partner. It is an application for a fictional customer, Hooli, which uses Verified Inc. to issue reusable <Tip type="credential">credentials</Tip> to its users and share them with another fictional customer, Kredita.

Additional information on how to issue credentials with a partner can be found in the Partner Issuance [guide](/issuance-guide#partner-issuance).
