The open source Hooli demo demonstrates an example implementation of the [issuing](https://www.verified.inc/issue) Verified Inc. digital identity cards which unlocks the [Free IDV](/issuance-guide) offering. It is an application for a fictional customer, Hooli, which uses Verified Inc. to issue reusable <Tip type="credential">credentials</Tip> to its users. 

Additional information on how to issue credentials can be found in Free IDV [guide](/issuance-guide) and in the API's issue credentials [documentation](/api-overview#issue-credentials).

## Web Demo
The live Hooli web application demo can be found [here](https://hooli-web.demo.sandbox-verifiedinc.com/login). Its open source code can be found on [Github](https://github.com/VerifiedInc/Hooli-Demo-Web).

Feel free to use a real email address that you control or our test account, richard@piedpiper.net. For the purposes of the demo, the password field is irrelevant. If then continuing to the [Kredita](/kredita-demo) demo it is important to use the same email there as the one used in Hooli. If opting to use the test account you can use the static OTP of `111111` to authenticate to the [wallet](https://wallet-beta.sandbox-verifiedinc.com/cards) - a necessary step in the Kredita demo.
