**Before you begin:** You need to be registered as an Verified Inc. customer to create a brand API key. You can register zero to many brands, depending on your use case. For API keys to use for authentication please reach out to support@verified.inc. _Our self service dashboard is coming soon!_

:::note
Postman documentation of this API can be found [here](https://api.docs.verified.inc/).
:::

## Overview

Integrating with Verified Inc. can be completed with minimal effort by following this documentation. That said, if you desire further assistance, please do not hesitate to reach out to support@verified.inc. Once complete, you will be able to boast [1-click](https://www.verified.inc/1-click) (or free) KYC onboarding and secure additional revenue streams for any user data shared with other network participants.

### Authentication

Every request detailed below requires an Verified Inc. ApiKey as an Authorization Bearer token header, which is used to authenticate requests to the Verified Inc. cloud.

:::caution
**API keys are sensitive, so please only use them in a secure backend service environment.** This means that ideally your clients will communicate with your own backend service, which will then call the Verified Inc. API. Your clients should never have direct access to your Verified Inc. API key.
:::

### Environments

Upon the ApiKey creation you will receive one for each environment: Sandbox and Production. We encourage that all integration work be done against the Sandbox environment.

The base url for the Sandbox API is `https://core-api.sandbox-unumid.co`.<br/>
The base url for the Production API is `https://core-api.verified.inc`.

## Functionality

The Verified Inc. API lets your company partcipate in the Verified Inc. identity data network. You can use the API methods to check if <Tip type="user">users</Tip> have credentials of interest, create <Tip type="request">requests</Tip> for and retrieve user data in the form of <Tip type="credential">credentials</Tip>, issue <Tip type="credential">credentials</Tip> of user data, and update previously issued credential statuses (e.g. to invalidate a credential)

Jump to:

- [Check User Credentials](#check-user-credentials)
- [Get Shared Credentials](#get-shared-credentials)
- [Issue Credentials](#issue-credentials)

### Check User Credentials

> Check if a user has matching <Tip type="credential">credentials</Tip>. If so, a <Tip type="request"/> is created to get the <Tip type="user">user</Tip>'s consent to share the data.

**Method**: `POST` <br />
**Path**: `/hasMatchingCredentials`

You need to provide:

1. credential request(s)

A credential requests encodes which <Tip type="credential">credentials</Tip> you're asking the user to share with your <Tip type="brand"/>. It's a list of one or more [`CredentialRequest`](https://docs.verified.inc/types/interfaces/credentialrequest.html) objects.

```typescript title="CredentialRequest"
{
  type: string; // the type of credential data being requested
  issuers: string[]; // list of acceptable brandIds; if empty, all issuer brands are valid
  required?: boolean; // if credential is required (default is true)
}
```

If you list multiple <Tip type="issuer">issuers</Tip>, the user can include a credential issued by _any one_ of those listed. If `issuers` is left empty the user can include a credential with matching type issued by _any_ issuer.

2. user's email or phone

:::caution
The same ApiKey necessary to call /hasMatchingCredentials grants you and only you access to the encrypted credential data documented in [Get Shared Credentials](#get-shared-credentials). Please keep this key secure.
:::

#### Request Body

```typescript
{
  credentialRequests: CredentialRequest[], // a list of one or more CredentialRequest objects. Encodes which credentials are being asked for.
  email?: string, // user's email address; optional if phone is provided
  phone?: string, // user's phone number; optional if email is provided
}
```

#### Response Body:

```typescript title="HasMatchingCredentials"
{
  "match": boolean // indicates whether the user has matching credentials
  "url": string // Verified Inc. Web Wallet url to redirect user to for credential request handling. It will redirect back to your client. Only present if match is true.
}
```

---

### Get Shared Credentials

> Get verified <Tip type="credential"/> data shared by a <Tip type="user"/>.

**Method**: `GET` <br />
**Path**: `/sharedCredentials/{uuid}`

When a <Tip type="user"/> responds to a <Tip type="request"/> the verified data is sent and stored securely awaiting retrieval. Additionally, as mentioned above in [Check User Credentials](#check-user-credentials), upon the user responding to the request, the user will be redirected back to your client with a `uuid` as a query parameter.

This endpoint allows you to retrieve the shared <Tip type="credential">credentials</Tip> data related to the <Tip type="request"/> created as a result of a successful match from the `/hasMatchingCredentials` endpoint.

You need to provide:

1. the `uuid` that was returned after redirecting the user to the `url` attribute from the `/hasMatchingCredentials`response

:::info
Your brand's access to shared credentials is deleted after 5 minutes of the initial credential data retrieval.
:::

The response body consists of Credential objects with the plaintext user data.

```typescript title="Credential"
{
    "id": string, // credential id
    "type": string, // credential type
    "issuer": string, // credential issuer brandId
    "issuanceDate": number, // when credential was created as a milliseconds since epoch unix timestamp
    "expirationDate"?: number, // when credentials expires as a milliseconds since epoch unix timestamp
    "data": Map<string, any> // credential data map that matches the credential type's JSON Schema definition
}
```

#### Response Body

```typescript title="SharedCredentials"
{
  "uuid": string // the uuid from the query parameter of the redirect back to your client; identifies the collection of credentials shared by the user
  "credentials": Credential[] // a list of one or more Credential objects
  "email"?: string // the user's email from the input to /hasMatchingCredentials; only present if email was provided
  "phone"?: string // the user's phone from the input to /hasMatchingCredentials; only present if phone was provided
}
```

To facilitate extracting the credential data we recommend leveraging the Schema Resolver to get the [schema](/schema) of the credential types. Because Credential schemas are immutable they can then be cached and referenced when retrieving the credential data.

---

### Issue Credentials

> Issue <Tip type="credential"/>s to a <Tip type="user"/>.

**Method**: `POST` <br />
**Path**: `/credentials`

You need to provide:

1. Credentials data array
2. Either a phone and/or email attribute

Data about the user, must comply with our credential [schema](/schema) definitions.

An example Credentials object is below:

```typescript title="Credentials"
{
  "type": string, // credential type
  "data": Map<string, any> // credential data map that matches the credential type's JSON Schema definition
  "expirationDate?": number // when the expires as a milliseconds since epoch unix timestamp; optional
}
```

:::note
An expiration date is not the only control on whether a credential is valid. You can also change the credential's status at any time, for example to revoke it. See [Update Credentials](#update-credentials) _coming soon_.
:::

:::info
Credential data is stored securely via a data privacy vault that encrypts and tokenizes the data. The data is only retrieved and decrypted for the brand that the <Tip type="user"/> agrees to share with.
:::

#### Request Body

```typescript
{
  "credentials": Credentials[], // a list of one or more Credentials objects
  "email"?: string, // user's email address; optional if phone is provided
  "phone"?: string, // user's phone number; optional if email is provided
}
```

#### Response Body:

```typescript title="Credential[]"
[{
  "id": string, // credential id
  "type": string, // credential type
  "email": string, // user's email address if provided
  "phone": string, // user's phone number if provided
  "data": Map<string, any> // credential data map that matches your provided data and the credential type's JSON Schema definition
  "issuanceDate": string, // when credential was created as a milliseconds since epoch unix timestamp
  "expirationDate?": number // when the expires as a milliseconds since epoch unix timestamp; optional
}]
```

The created and issued credentials contains an `id` that you should store. You'll need this, for example, if you ever want to revoke the credential. **We recommend storing the entire credential, indexed on the credential `id`.** If you _only_ store the credential `id`, it'll be very difficult to later remember what the `id` corresponds to.
