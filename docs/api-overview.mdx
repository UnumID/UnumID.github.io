## Overview

Integrating with Verified Inc. can be completed with minimal effort by following this documentation. That said, if you desire further assistance, please do not hesitate to reach out to support@verified.inc. Once complete, you will be able to boast [1-click](https://www.verified.inc/1-click) (or free) KYC onboarding and secure additional revenue streams for any user data shared with other network participants.

:::note
Postman documentation of this API can be found [here](https://api.docs.verified.inc/).
:::

### Authentication

Every request detailed below requires an Verified Inc. ApiKey as an Authorization Bearer token header, which is used to authenticate requests to the Verified Inc. cloud. For API keys to use for authentication please reach out to support@verified.inc. _Our self service dashboard is coming soon!_

:::caution
**API keys are sensitive, so please only use them in a secure backend service environment.** This means that ideally your clients will communicate with your own backend service, which will then call the Verified Inc. API. Your clients should never have direct access to your Verified Inc. API key.
:::

### Environments

Upon the ApiKey creation you will receive one for each environment: Sandbox and Production. We encourage that all integration work be done against the Sandbox environment.

The base url for the Sandbox API is `https://core-api.sandbox-verifiedinc.com`.<br/>
The base url for the Production API is `https://core-api.verified.inc`.

The wallet url for the Sandbox environment is `https://wallet.sandbox-verifiedinc.com`.<br/>
The wallet url for the Production environment is `https://wallet.verified.inc`.

### Development

While developing your integration you can use a dummy user account if you would like.

```json test
email: richard@piedpiper.net
phone: +10123456789
```

By using these test identifiers you can authenticate to the wallet using a static OTP value of `111111`, allowing you to test the full flow of the integration more easily. We recommend using a proper test email or phone to recieve actual OTP authentication messages during the final stages of development.

## Functionality

The Verified Inc. API lets your company partcipate in the Verified Inc. identity data network. You can use the API methods to check if <Tip type="user">users</Tip> have credentials of interest, create <Tip type="request">requests</Tip> for and retrieve user data in the form of <Tip type="credential">credentials</Tip>, issue <Tip type="credential">credentials</Tip> of user data, and update previously issued credential statuses (e.g. to invalidate a credential)

- [Check User Credentials](#check-user-credentials)
- [Get Shared Credentials](#get-shared-credentials)
- [Issue Credentials](#issue-credentials)

### Check User Credentials

> Check if a user has matching <Tip type="credential">credentials</Tip>. If so, a <Tip type="request"/> is created to get the <Tip type="user">user</Tip>'s consent to share the data.

**Method**: `POST` <br />
**Path**: `/hasMatchingCredentials`

You need to provide:

1. User's email or phone
2. (Optional) Credential request(s). _Required if Partner UUID is not provided._
3. (Optional) Partner UUID. _More information on the partner UUID use case can be found in the [Issuance Guide](/issuance-guide#already-issued-credentials)._
4. (Optional) List of the sub-credentials that make up the credential. _If not provided, all sub-credentials will be returned._

A credential requests encodes which <Tip type="credential">credentials</Tip> you're asking the user to share with your <Tip type="brand"/>. It's a list of one or more [`CredentialRequest`](https://docs.verified.inc/types/interfaces/credentialrequest.html) objects.

<CredentialRequestCodeSnippet />

If you list multiple <Tip type="issuer">issuers</Tip>, the user can include a credential issued by _any one_ of those listed. If `issuers` is left empty the user can include a credential with matching type issued by _any_ issuer.

:::note
The Credential <Tip type="request">requests</Tip> attribute is required if a Partner UUID is **not** provided. If Partner UUID is provided, the Credential requests attribute is not used. Instead, a pre-defined set of accepting partner's credentials requests are used.
_More information on the partner UUID use case can be found in the [Issuance Guide](/issuance-guide#already-issued-credentials)._
:::

:::tip
If <b>mandatory</b> field are missing, then the credential will be treated as optional.
:::

:::note
The Credential <Tip type="request">requests</Tip> objects can contain a `children` attribute. This attribute is used to specify the sub-credentials that make up the credential. If not provided, all sub-credentials will be returned.
(eg: If you request a <Tip type="credential">credential</Tip> of type `AddressCredential` and you only want the `city` and `state` sub-credentials, you can specify that in the `children` attribute.)
:::

:::caution
The same ApiKey necessary to call /hasMatchingCredentials grants you and only you access to the encrypted credential data documented in [Get Shared Credentials](#get-shared-credentials). Please keep this key secure.
:::

#### Request Body

```typescript
{
  email?: string, // user's email address; optional if phone is provided
  phone?: string, // user's phone number; optional if email is provided
  credentialRequests: CredentialRequest[], // a list of one or more CredentialRequest objects. Encodes which credentials are being asked for; not used if partnerUuid is provided
  partnerUuid?: string, // partner's uuid; optional
  description?: string // A description displayed in the consent page header. If no description is provided, a default value will be displayed.
}
```

#### Response Body:

```typescript title="HasMatchingCredentials"
{
  "match": boolean, // indicates whether the user has matching credentials
  "url": string // Verified Inc. Web Wallet url to redirect user to for credential request handling. It will redirect back to your client. Only present if match is true.
}
```

The `url` from the response ought to then be enriched with a `redirectUrl` query param that will take the next step in your target service's user onboarding webpage. _More information on this can be found in the [Acceptance Guide](/acceptance-guide)._

:::info Example Credential Request

For example, if you want to check if a user has credentials of type `SsnCredential`, `FullNameCredential` and `AddressCredential` issued by any issuer you would send the following request:

<details>
<summary>Request Body</summary>
<p>

```json
{
  "email": "richard@piedpiper.net",
  "credentialRequests": [
    {
      "type": "SsnCredential",
      "issuers": [],
      "mandatory": "yes"
    },
    {
      "type": "FullNameCredential",
      "issuers": [],
      "mandatory": "yes"
    },
    {
        "type": "PhoneCredential",
        "issuers": [],
        "mandatory": "if_available",
        "allowUserInput": true
    },
    {
      "type": "AddressCredential",
      "issuers": [],
      "children": [
        {
          "type": "CityCredential",
          "issuers": [],
          "mandatory": "if_available"
        },
        {
          "type": "StateCredential",
          "issuers": [],
          "mandatory": "yes"
        },
        {
          "type": "CountryCredential",
          "issuers": [],
          "mandatory": "yes"
        },
        {
          "type": "ZipCodeCredential",
          "issuers": []
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

</p>
</details>


Let's break this down to understand what is happening here:

- `SsnCredential` is a "[single attribute atomic credential](/schema#schema-definitions)" and therefore does not have any sub-credentials. Because it is marked as `mandatory`, it only matches if the user has a credential.

```json title="SnnCredential"
{
  "type": "SsnCredential",
  "issuers": [],
  "mandatory": "yes"
}
```

- `FullNameCredential` is a "[composite credential](/schema#schema-definitions)" and therefore has *2 sub-credentials*ยน: `FirstNameCredential`, `LastNameCredential`. Because it is marked as `mandatory`, and it has no `children` attribute, it only matches if the user has a credential with all sub-credentials.

```json title="FullNameCredential"
{
  "type": "FullNameCredential",
  "issuers": [],
  "mandatory": "yes"
}
```


- `PhoneCredential` is a "[single attribute atomic credential](/schema#schema-definitions)" and therefore does not have any sub-credentials. Because we set a `allowUserInput` attribute of `true`, the user will be given an opportunity to enter a new value if they choose."

```json title="PhoneCredential"
{
    "type": "PhoneCredential",
    "issuers": [],
    "mandatory": "if_available",
    "allowUserInput": true
}
```

- The `AddressCredential` credential is made up of 6 sub-credentials: `Line1Credential`, `Line2Credential`, `CityCredential`, `StateCredential`, `CountryCredential` and `ZipCodeCredential`.

  But because we specified a `children` attribute, we are only asking for the `CityCredential`, `StateCredential`, `CountryCredential` and `ZipCodeCredential` sub-credentials. So `Line1Credential` and `Line2Credential` are ignored.

  ```json title="AddressCredential"
  {
    "type": "AddressCredential",
    "issuers": [],
    "children": [
      {
        "type": "CityCredential",
        "issuers": [],
        "mandatory": "if_available"
      },
      {
        "type": "StateCredential",
        "issuers": [],
        "mandatory": "yes"
      },
      {
        "type": "CountryCredential",
        "issuers": [],
        "mandatory": "yes"
      },
      {
        "type": "ZipCodeCredential",
        "issuers": []
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

The user will be asked to share the `CityCredential` if available (this means if the user has a credential of type `CityCredential` it will be mandatory, but if the user does not have a credential of type `CityCredential` the user will still be able to share the `AddressCredential` credential).

  `StateCredential` and `CountryCredential` are mandatory and therefore the user must have a credential of each type to match.

  `ZipCodeCredential` is optional and therefore the user may or may not have a credential of type to match.

### Get Shared Credentials

> Get verified <Tip type="credential"/> data shared by a <Tip type="user"/>.

**Method**: `GET` <br />
**Path**: `/sharedCredentials/{sharedCredentialsUuid}`

When a <Tip type="user"/> responds to a <Tip type="request"/> the verified data is sent and stored securely awaiting retrieval. Additionally, as mentioned above in [Check User Credentials](#check-user-credentials), upon the user responding to the request, the user will be redirected back to your client with a `sharedCredentialsUuid` as a query parameter.

This endpoint allows you to retrieve the shared <Tip type="credential">credentials</Tip> data related to the <Tip type="request"/> created as a result of a successful match from the `/hasMatchingCredentials` endpoint.

You need to provide:

- the `sharedCredentialsUuid` that was returned in the query param after redirecting the user to the `redirectUrl` attribute from the `/hasMatchingCredentials`response

:::info
Your brand's access to shared credentials is deleted after 5 minutes of the initial credential data retrieval.
:::

The response body consists of Credential objects with the plaintext user data.

```typescript title="Credential"
{
    "id": string, // credential id
    "type": string, // credential type
    "issuer": string, // credential issuer brandId
    "issuanceDate": number, // when credential was created as a milliseconds since epoch unix timestamp
    "expirationDate"?: number, // when credentials expires as a milliseconds since epoch unix timestamp
    "data": Map<string, any> | Credential[] // credential data map/array that matches the credential type's JSON Schema definition
}
```

#### Response Body

```typescript title="SharedCredentials"
{
  "uuid": string, // the uuid from the query parameter of the redirect back to your client; identifies the collection of credentials shared by the user
  "credentials": Credential[], // a list of one or more Credential objects
  "email"?: string, // the user's email from the input to /hasMatchingCredentials; only present if email was provided
  "phone"?: string // the user's phone from the input to /hasMatchingCredentials; only present if phone was provided
}
```

To facilitate extracting the credential data we recommend leveraging the Schema Resolver to get the [schema](/schema) of the credential types. Because Credential schemas are immutable they can then be cached and referenced when retrieving the credential data.

---

### Issue Credentials

> Issue <Tip type="credential"/>s to a <Tip type="user"/>.

**Method**: `POST` <br />
**Path**: `/credentials`

You need to provide:

1. Credentials data array
2. Either a phone and/or email attribute
3. (Optional) Partner UUID. _More information on the partner UUID use case can be found in the [Issuance Guide](/issuance-guide#partner-issuance)._
4. (Optional) Tracking Identifier for credential usage attribute. _More information on the tracking identifier use case can be found in the [Issuance Guide](/issuance-guide#tracking-identifier)._

Data about the user, must comply with our credential [schema](/schema) definitions.

An example Credentials object is below:

```typescript title="Credentials"
{
  "type": string, // credential type
  "data": Map<string, any> | Credentials[], // credential data map/array that matches the credential type's JSON Schema definition
  "id"?: string, // credential id - uuid formatted; optional. If not provided, a random uuid will be generated
  "expirationDate?": number // when the credential expires as a milliseconds since unix epoch; optional
}
```

While not required, we recommend providing a unique `id` following `uuid` [format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier) for each credential. This allows for idempotent credential issuance - meaning if a duplicate `id` value is seen another credential will not be created. Expect a HTTP status code of `409` if this is the case. If you do not provide an `id`, a random uuid will be generated for you.

:::note
An expiration date is not the only control on whether a credential is valid. You can also change the credential's status at any time, for example to revoke it. See [Patch Credentials](#patch-credentials).
:::

:::info
Credential data is stored securely via a data privacy vault that encrypts and tokenizes the data. The data is only retrieved and decrypted for the brand that the <Tip type="user"/> agrees to share with.
:::

:::info Composite Credentials
Composite credentials are credentials that are made up of other credentials. For example, a `FullNameCredential` is made up of `FirstNameCredential`, `MiddleNameCredential`(optional), and `LastNameCredential`. When issuing a composite credential, you must provide the child credentials as well.

<details>
<summary>Example</summary>

```typescript title="Composite Credential"
{
  "type": "FullNameCredential",
  // based on the properties attribute of the schema
  // highlight-start
  // note that the data is an array of objects, not a single object
  "data": [
    {
      "type": "FirstNameCredential",
      "data": {
        "firstName": "Richard"
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "LastNameCredential",
      "data": {
        "lastName": "Hendricks"
      }
    }
  ]
  // highlight-end
}
```

</details>

See [Data Schemas](/schema) for more information.
:::

#### Request Body

```typescript
{
  "credentials": Credentials[], // a list of one or more Credentials objects
  "email"?: string, // user's email address; optional if phone is provided
  "phone"?: string // user's phone number; optional if email is provided
  "trackingId"?: string // user tracking identifier
}
```

#### Response Body:

```typescript title="CredentialsDto"
{
  "email": string, // user's email address if provided
  "phone": phone, // user's phone number if provided
  "trackingId"?: string // user tracking identifier if provided
  "credentials": [{
    "id": string, // credential id
    "type": string, // credential type
    "data": Map<string, any> | Credentials[], // credential data map/array that matches your provided data and the credential type's JSON Schema definition
    "issuanceDate": string, // when credential was created as a milliseconds since epoch unix timestamp
    "expirationDate?": string, // when the credential expires as a milliseconds since unix epoch; optional
    "status": 'valid' | 'revoked' // an enum to denote whether the credential is valid (all credentials are valid when first issued) โ note that this is independent of the expirationDate
  }],
  "url"?: string // Only present if partnerUuid was provided and conditions are met. See the Issuance Guide for more information.
}
```

The issued credential contains an `id` that you should store. You'll need this, for example, if you ever want to revoke the credential. **We recommend storing the entire credential, indexed on the credential `id`.** However, it is also an acceptable to store credential `id`s associated with a user and use the [Get Credential](/api-overview#get-credential) or [Get All User Credentials](/api-overview#get-all-user-credentials) endpoint to retrieve the full credential.

---

### Patch Credential

> Patch a previously issued <Tip type="credential"/>.

**Method**: `PATCH` <br />
**Path**: `/credentials/{id}`

You can optionally provide any of the following in the request body:

1. (Optional) new credential data
2. (Optional) new credential expiration date
3. (Optional) new credential status

Credential data must comply with our credential [schema](/schema) definitions.

:::note
If a credential is expired but the status is 'valid' it is an unusable credential. Likewise, if the credential as not expired but the status is 'revoked', it is also not usable credential.
:::

:::info
Credential data is stored securely via a data privacy vault that encrypts and tokenizes the data. The data is only retrieved and decrypted for the brand that the <Tip type="user"/> agrees to share with.
:::

#### Request Body

```typescript
{
  "data": Map<string, any> | Credentials[], // credential data map/array that matches the credential type's JSON schema definition
  "expirationDate?": number // when the credentials expires as a milliseconds since epoch unix timestamp; optional
  "status": 'valid' | 'revoked' // an enum to denote whether the credential is valid (all credentials are valid when first issued) โ note that this is independent of the expirationDate
}
```

#### Response Body:

```typescript title="CredentialDto"
{
  "id": string, // credential id
  "type": string, // credential type
  "data": Map<string, any> | Credentials[], // credential data map/array that matches your provided data and the credential type's JSON Schema definition
  "issuanceDate": string, // when credential was created as a milliseconds since epoch unix timestamp
  "expirationDate?": number, // when the credential expires as a milliseconds since epoch unix timestamp; optional
  "status": 'valid' | 'revoked' // an enum to denote whether the credential is valid (all credentials are valid when first issued) โ note that this is independent of the expirationDate.
}
```

The resultant credential `id` remains the same, so after a 200 HTTP response code is received, nothing further needs to be updated on your end.

---

### Patch All User Credentials

> Patch all previously issued <Tip type="credentials"/> by your brand to a user.

**Method**: `PATCH` <br />
**Path**: `/userCredentials/{userIdentifier}`

A <Tip type="userIdentifier"/> is either a phone number or email address associated with a user.

The only credential value that can by updated in this manner is `status`. A credential status must be in the request body.

:::note
This endpoint all modifies credentials issued to the user by your brand.
:::

#### Request Body

```typescript
{
  "status": 'valid' | 'revoked' // an enum to denote whether the credential is valid (all credentials are valid when first issued) โ note that this is independent of the expirationDate
}
```

#### Response Body:

```typescript title="UserCredentialsDto"
{
  "credentials": {
    "id": string, // credential id
    "type": string, // credential type
    "data": Map<string, any> | Credentials[], // credential data map/array that matches your provided data and the credential type's JSON Schema definition
    "issuanceDate": string, // when credential was created as a milliseconds since epoch unix timestamp
    "expirationDate?": number, // when the credential expires as a milliseconds since epoch unix timestamp; optional
    "status": 'valid' | 'revoked' // an enum to denote whether the credential is valid (all credentials are valid when first issued) โ note that this is independent of the expirationDate.
  }[]
}
```

The response body contains a list of all credentials that were modified on the `credentials` key.

---

### Get Credential

> Get a previously issued <Tip type="credential"/>.

**Method**: `GET` <br />
**Path**: `/credentials/{id}`

This endpoint returns a credential (issued by your brand) via the credential `id`.

#### Response Body:

```typescript title="CredentialDto"
{
  "id": string, // credential id
  "type": string, // credential type
  "data": Map<string, any> | Credentials[], // credential data map/array that matches your provided data and the credential type's JSON Schema definition
  "issuanceDate": string, // when credential was created as a milliseconds since epoch unix timestamp
  "expirationDate?": number, // when the credential expires as a milliseconds since epoch unix timestamp; optional
  "status": 'valid' | 'revoked' // an enum to denote whether the credential is valid (all credentials are valid when first issued) โ note that this is independent of the expirationDate.
}
```

---

### Get All User Credentials

> Get all previously issued <Tip type="credentials"/> by your brand to a user.

**Method**: `GET` <br />
**Path**: `/userCredentials/{userIdentifier}`

A <Tip type="userIdentifier"/> is either a phone number or email address associated with a user.

:::note
This endpoint all modifies credentials issued to the user by your brand.
:::

:::caution
It should be clear that this endpoint should not be used in place of [`/hasMatchingCredentials`](/api-overview/#check-user-credentials), which can check user credentials across many issuers but does not return the credentials' values.

This endpoint is simply a nice to have for an issuer to see all credentials they have issued to a user.
:::

#### Response Body:

```typescript title="UserCredentialsDto"
{
  "credentials": {
    "id": string, // credential id
    "type": string, // credential type
    "data": Map<string, any> | Credentials[], // credential data map/array that matches your provided data and the credential type's JSON Schema definition
    "issuanceDate": string, // when credential was created as a milliseconds since epoch unix timestamp
    "expirationDate?": number, // when the credential expires as a milliseconds since epoch unix timestamp; optional
    "status": 'valid' | 'revoked' // an enum to denote whether the credential is valid (all credentials are valid when first issued) โ note that this is independent of the expirationDate.
  }[]
}
```

The response body contains a list of all credentials on the `credentials` key.

---

### Get Partner Credential Requests

> Get the partner's pre-defined <Tip type="request">credential requests</Tip>.

**Method**: `GET` <br />
**Path**: `/credentialRequests/{partnerUuid}`

This endpoint returns a list of credential requests that the partner has defined for their brand.

#### Response Body:

```typescript title="CredentialRequestsResponse"
{
  "credentialRequests": CredentialRequest[]
}
```

<CredentialRequestCodeSnippet />

:::note
This endpoint is helpful when developing the partner issuance flow. More information about partner issuance can be found in the [Issuance Guide](/issuance-guide#partner-issuance).
