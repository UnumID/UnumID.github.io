The open source Hooli demo demonstrates an example implementation of the [issuing](https://www.verified.inc/issue) Verified Inc. digital identity cards which unlocks the [Free IDV](/issuance-guide) offering. It is an application for a fictional customer, Hooli, which uses Verified Inc. to issue reusable <Tip type="credential">credentials</Tip> to its users. 

Additional information on how to issue credentials can be found in Free IDV [guide](/issuance-guide) and in the API's issue credentials [documentation](/api-overview#issue-credentials).

## Web Demo
The live Hooli web application demo can be found [here](https://hooli-web.demo.sandbox-verifiedinc.com/login). Its open source code can be found on [Github](https://github.com/UnumID/Hooli-Demo-Web).

Feel free to use a real email address that you control or our test account, richard@piedpiper.net. Whatever value used, the password field on the demo login page is irrelevant for the purposes of the demo. It is important use the same email if then continuing to the [Kredita](/kredita-demo) demo. If opting to use Richard test account, you can use the static OTP of `111111` to authenticate to the [wallet](https://wallet-beta.sandbox-verifiedinc.com/cards) - a necessary step in the Kredita demo.
