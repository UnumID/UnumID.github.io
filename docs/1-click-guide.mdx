You will need an API key and an email and/or phone for each user. Below is a valid API Key and URL for your initial usage along with suggested test email and phone values.

If you use these suggested test email and/or phone values you can authenticate to the wallet using those values, i.e. richard@piedpiper.net, using a static OTP of `111111`.

## Motivations

Using the 1-Click Signup flow, you will allow users to easily retrieve and verify their:

- first and last name
- phone number
- email
- address
- birth date
- social security number

This data is from Identity Verification Providers (IDV), and is packaged in manner that allows users to share with 1-Click.

In brief: using the 1-Click the Verified Inc. network, you will gain all the benefits of being an [Acceptor](/acceptance-guide#motivations) but with additional value…

- Leverage identity data that always provided by a trusted identity verification provider.
- Our fastest and easiest integration experience to get it up and running.
- Impress 95% of United States adults with this truly 1-Click experience.

## Implementation

  1. **Call [`/1-click`](/api-overview/#1-click-onboarding)** with the user's phone. If there is a match, will be the case for 95% of US adults, you will get a URL value in the response body.

  ```typescript title="Example Response Body"
    {
        "url": "https://wallet.verified.inc/request/9f2053fc-cc4c-41cb-8d14-7d3ccf6167eb"
    }
  ```

  <details>
    <summary>Match for 95% of US Adults?</summary>
    <p>
      Yes, we have data for 95% of US adults through our service providers. When you call <code>/1-click</code> using our default credential requests value, we can rely on our IDV service providers having the necessary data. We have found that we can data on 95% of US adults. 
      This accessible data incudes:
      <ul>
        <li>
          first name
        </li>
        <li>
          last name
        </li>
        <li>
          email
        </li>
        <li>
          phone
        </li>
        <li>
          address
        </li>
        <li>
          birth date
        </li>
        <li>
          social security number
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

  </details>
    
  The user will either have matching credentials, or they won't. If they do, continue to step (2). If they don't you should take the user through your existing verification flow.

  2. **Direct the user to the `url`** the response body contains with an additional `redirectUrl` query param that you define which will serve as the ultimate landing page after the user completes 1-Click IDV from the Verified Inc. web wallet. For example the final url you need to redirect the user to is:

  ```text title="Example Redirect to Verified Inc. Wallet URL"
  https://wallet.verified.inc/request/9f2053fc-cc4c-41cb-8d14-7d3ccf6167eb?redirectUrl=https://acme-bank.co/sign-up/complete
  ```

  3. **Capture the `sharedCredentialsUuid` query param** from the `redirectUrl` page you defined in step (2). To continue the example in step (2), the final url the user will be redirected to will be something like this:

  ```text title="Example Redirect Back to Acme Bank URL"
  https://acme-bank.co/sign-up/complete?sharedCredentialsUuid=37ce0fff-af32-457e-9458-057125eb417d
  ````

  4. **Call `/sharedCredentials/{uuid}`** from your backend with the `sharedCredentialsUuid` the callback URL contains. The response body will contain the credentials the user agreed to share via 1-Click IDV.

  <SharedCredentialsAtomicExample/>

  It's easiest to extract the data from each credential using the corresponding [schema](/schema). The extracted data is verified according to the issuer of the credential, but you can perform additional verification steps if you like.

  ✅ **_You're done!_**


## Integration Testing
All testing and development ought to be done against our Sandbox environment. The publicly published [Postman collection's](https://api.docs.verified.inc/) *Integration Test Suite* is very helpful facilitating testing your Acceptor integration. All instructions below are in reference to this Postman collection. *If you are more accustom to an alternative HTTP request client for development purposes, please let us know and we maybe be able to accommodate you.*

To test either flavor of integration, you need to replace the `acceptorBrandApiKey` from the also published `Public API` environment variables with your brand's Sandbox API key to make the calls to `/1-click` and `/sharedCredentials/{uuid}`.

:::note
Some pre-configuration is necessary to test this appropriately. However, if we have already given you an ApiKey this should already be done for you. If you are unsure, please contact us.
:::

Testing in our Sandbox environment will be returning mocked data from our IDV service providers. We can configure that data in the response to suite your needs.
