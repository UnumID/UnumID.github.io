As noted in [About Unum ID](/about-unum-id), what distinguishes Unum 
ID from other identity solutions is that each user’s data is stored 
in their own app, and only you and that specific user ever have 
access to it. ​**We coordinate sharing of data without ever being 
able to interact with it in plaintext.** ​This provides unparalleled 
security and privacy. As the “encrypted domain” in our diagrams 
indicates, sensitive data is never decrypted.

How exactly we do this is complex and proprietary, but at a high 
level it works as follows. When you issue a credential (containing
some data) to a user, that credential is encrypted with the user’s 
public key. (The Server SDK does this on your server and sends the 
encrypted version to us.) We temporarily store and route the 
encrypted credential to the correct user’s app but have no ability 
to decrypt the data. The user’s app then receives and decrypts the 
credential. See the diagram below.

Then, when a user responds to a request for a credential, that 
credential is encrypted with your publickey. (The Mobile SDK does 
this in the user’s app and sends the encrypted version to us.) 
We store metadata about the encrypted credential and route it to 
you but have no ability to decrypt the data. You then receive and 
decrypt the credential. See the diagram below.

We accomplish all this with a state-of-the-art *​distributed* system — 
not a massive central database vulnerable to attack and privacy 
violations. This is the real magic of Unum ID:
- **We ​never ​have access to ​*any* ​sensitive user data.** All such 
data is encrypted before we receive it, in such a way that only that 
specific user can access it. Other solutions pool user data from many 
sources in central databases, which are honeypots extremely vulnerable 
to attack. Our distributed architecture is extremely security 
conscious and ensures neither your company nor Unum ID will ever join 
this infamous club:

- **The user has full control over their data.** The data is stored 
only on their device, and it’s only shared with their consent. 
Unum ID is a solution custom built for an age of GDPR, CCPA, and 
countless other emerging privacy regulations. We are well beyond 
compliant.
- **The user’s data is robustly tied back to a single human being.** 
​Verified user data is only reliable if there’s a secure, 1:1 
connection between that data a person in the real world. Unum ID 
establishes and maintains that connection. We use a complex, 
proprietary combination of cryptography to tie the data to a device 
and biometrics and behavioral auth to tie that device a single user.
