import TooltipWithDefaults from '../src/components/TooltipWithDefaults';
import Tip from '../src/components/Tip';

This is a lightweight TypeScript SDK that lets your company act as one or more <Tip type="issuer">issuers</Tip> and/or <Tip  type="verifier">verifiers</Tip>.

**Before you begin:** You need to be registered as an Unum ID customer, and you need to register at least one issuer or verifier. (You can register zero to many of each, depending on your use case.) You'll receive issuer and verifier API keys to use with this SDK.

:::note
More detailed but less styled documentation can be found [here](https://docs.unum.id/Server-SDK-Typescript/index.html). This serves as a useful technical reference. 
:::

## Overview
The Server SDK uses the `UnumDto` type to facilitate handling many response body types, while providing a reliable structure to access the result body (and, importantly, the rolling JWT `authToken`).

```typescript title="UnumDto"
{
  "authToken": string; // The JWT auth token which is used by the SDK to authenticate with UnumID's SaaS. This is periodically refreshed thus its value should be read and stored in every resultant function call. 
  "body": T; // The placeholder for the function's response type is function specific. 
}
```

### Authentication
Every request detailed below requires a bearer `authToken` as a first parameter. This is used to authenticate requests to the Unum ID cloud. This auth token is updated on every subsequent function call and should be read via the `authToken` attribute and persisted accordingly for later requests. 

### Errors
Errors returned by the Unum ID cloud will also be wrapped in the `UnumDto` object so that the potentially updated `authToken` can be retrieved. Validation errors, which are created prior to any calls to Unum ID, will be of type `Error` and are thrown. Because in this case a network call is never made, there's no potential new `authToken` to pass back. For this reason, **we recommend wrapping all SDK calls in a try/catch.**

### Distribution
This project is open [source]((https://github.com/UnumID/Server-SDK-Typescript)) and publicly published on the official npm [registry](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@unumid/server-sdk). For example it can be pulled with: 
```
npm i @unumid/server-sdk
``` 
or 
```
yarn add @unumid/server-sdk
```

### Global Dependencies
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) v14.0.0 or higher (preferably v14.15.0 or higher)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Logging
The default logs level is `info`. You can change this to `debug` for more information (set the environment variable `LOG_LEVEL = debug`). The logs default to `stdout`, so you can easily aggregate them from disk using the log provider of your choice.

We use standard NPM log levels. Learn more about these [here](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston#logging-levels).

## Issuer
You can use the Server SDK to act as an <Tip type="issuer"/>, for example to issue credentials and change credential statuses.

- [`registerIssuer`](#registerissuer)
- [`issueCredential`](#issuecredential)
- [`updateCredentialStatus`](#updatecredentialstatus)

---

### `registerIssuer`
> Register an <Tip type="issuer"/> (corresponding to your customer UUID and issuer API key). 

As a customer, you can register as many issuers as you like (or none at all), depending on your use case. Note, however, that you'll need a unique issuer API key for each one.

:::important
You need to store the <Tip type="DID"/> (`did`) and encryption and signing key pairs (`keys`) that this returns. You'll need these to issue credentials to users.
:::

:::danger
The DID and public keys are nonsensitive, but **you should store the private keys securely and *never* share them.**
:::

#### Parameters
```typescript
"name": string, // human readable name for issuer. Displayed to users in mobile apps when verifiers request credentials.
"customerUuid": string, // your customer UUID
"apiKey": string // your issuer API key
```

#### Response Body: [`RegisteredIssuer`](https://docs.unum.id/Server-SDK-Typescript/interfaces/registeredissuer.html)
```typescript title="RegisteredIssuer"
{
  "uuid": string, // identifies issuer in Unum ID database
  "customerUuid": string, // identifies customer in Unum ID database
  /* To store: */
  // highlight-next-line
  "did": string, // identifies issuer in Unum ID ecosystem
  "name": string, // human-readable name for issuer
  "createdAt": string, // when issuer was registered
  "updatedAt": string, // when issuer was last updated
  /* To store: */
  // highlight-start
  "keys": {
    "signing": {
      "privateKey": string, // you use this to create signatures on credentials
      "publicKey": string, // subjects and verifiers use this to verify your signatures on credentials
    }
    "encryption": {
      "privateKey": string, // you use this to encrypt credentials you send to subjects
      "publicKey": string, // subjects use this to decrypt credentials they receive from you
    }
  }
  // highlight-end
}
```

---

### `issueCredential`
> Issue a <Tip type="credential"/> to a <Tip type="subject"/>.

You need to provide:

1. your issuer <Tip type="DID"/> 
2. your issuer signing private key
3. credential type
4. data about the <Tip type="subject"/>

The first two are returned by [`registerIssuer`](#registerissuer). The third (credential type) is part of what verifiers use to <Tip type="request"/> credentials from users. For example, Hooli FinTech might request a credential of type `KYCVerification`, issued by ACME Bank. The fourth (data about the subject) can be any valid JSON.

You can optionally provide:

5. expiration date

:::note
An expiration date is not the only control on whether a credential is valid. You can also change the credential's status at any time, for example to revoke it (see [`updateCredentialStatus`](#updatecredentialstatus)).
:::

`issueCredential` returns a credential `id` that you should store. You'll need this, for example, if you ever want to revoke the credential. **We recommend storing the entire credential, indexed on the credential `id`.** If you *only* store the credential `id`, it'll be very difficult to later remember what the `id` corresponds to.

:::note
In the full `credential` object that's returned, there are also `id` fields within `credentialSubject` and `credentialStatus`, but these are different. They refer to the subject <Tip type="DID"/> and credential status identifiers, respectively, as defined in the emerging [W3C Verifiable Credential specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#credential-subject).
:::

:::important
The private key *never* leaves your server. The Server SDK only needs it to perform cryptographic functions on your behalf.
:::

#### Parameters
```typescript
"type": string || string[], // The Credential type(s)
"issuer": string, // your issuer DID
"credentialSubject": {
  "id": string, // subject DID
  [key: string]: any, // data about subject (any valid JSON)
},
"signingPrivateKey": string // your issuer signing private key
"expirationDate"?: string, // (optional) when credential will no longer be valid (ISO 8601 date/time)
```

#### Response Body: [`Credential`](https://docs.unum.id/Server-SDK-Typescript/interfaces/credential.html)
```typescript title="Credential"
{
    "@context": ["https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1"], // for conformance with W3C Verifiable Credential spec
    "credentialStatus": {
        "id": string, // a url for credential's status
        "type": "CredentialStatus"
    },
    // a string representation of a object with any keys and with an id attribute
    "credentialSubject": stringify({
        "id": string, // subject DID
        [key: string]: any, // // data about subject
    }),
    "issuer": string, // issuer DID
    "type": string[], // credential type(s), always begins with "VerifiableCredential"
    /* To store: */
    // highlight-next-line
    "id": string, // identifies credential (version 4 UUID)
    "issuanceDate": string, // when credential was issued (ISO 8601 date/time)
    "expirationDate": string, // when credential will no longer be valid (ISO 8601 date-time)
    "proof": Proof // cryptographic proof created by signing credential with your issuer signing private key. Can be used to verify credential.
}
```

---

### `updateCredentialStatus`
> Revoke a <Tip type="credential"/> (i.e. make it invalid).

You need to provide the credential `id` (which [`issueCredential`](#issuecredential) returns) and a [CredentialStatusOptions](https://docs.unum.id/types/modules.html#credentialstatusoptions) `status`. Currently there are only two valid statuses: "valid" and "revoked".

:::note
As noted in [`issueCredential`](#issuecredential), **we recommend storing the entire credential, indexed on the credential `id`.** If you *only* store the credential `id`, it'll be very difficult to later remember what the `id` corresponds to.
:::

```typescript title="CredentialStatusOptions"
export type CredentialStatusOptions = 'valid' | 'revoked';
```

#### Parameters
```typescript
{
  "credentialId": string, // id of the credential
  "status": CredentialStatusOptions // status to update the credential to (defaults to 'revoked')
}
```

#### Response Body: Empty
If unsuccessful, an exception will be thrown.
```typescript
{}
```

---

## Verifier
You can use the Server SDK to act as an <Tip type="verifier"/>, for example to make <Tip type="request">requests</Tip> and verify <Tip type="presentation">presentations</Tip>.

Jump to:
- [`registerVerifier`](#registerverifier)
- [`sendRequest`](#sendrequest)
- [`verifyPresentation`](#verifypresentation)
- [`sendSms`](#sendsms)
- [`sendEmail`](#sendemail)

---

### `registerVerifier`
> Register a <Tip type="verifier"/> (corresponding to your customer UUID and verifier API key). 

As a customer, you can register as many verifiers as you like (or none at all), depending on your use case. Note, however, that you'll need a unique verifier API key for each one.

:::important
You need to store the <Tip type="DID"/> (`did`) and encryption and signing key pairs (`keys`) that this returns. You'll need these to make requests and verify presentations.
:::

:::danger
The DID and public keys are nonsensitive, but **you should store the private keys securely and *never* share them.**
:::

#### Parameters
```typescript
"name": string, // human readable name for verifier. Displayed to users in mobile apps when you make requests.
"customerUuid": string, // your customer UUID
"url": string, // the url of which UnumID's SaaS will interface with
"apiKey": string // your verifier API key
```

#### Response Body: [`RegisteredVerifier`](https://docs.unum.id/Server-SDK-Typescript/interfaces/registeredverifier.html)
```typescript title="RegisteredVerifier"
{
  "uuid": string, // identifies verifier in Unum ID database
  "customerUuid": string, // identifies customer in Unum ID database
  /* To store: */
  // highlight-next-line
  "did": string, // identifiers verifier in Unum ID ecosystem
  "name": string, // human-readable name for verifier
  "createdAt": string, // when verifier was registered (ISO 8601 date/time)
  "updatedAt": string, // when verifier was last updated (ISO 8601 date/time)
  /* To store: */
  // highlight-start
  "keys": {
    "signing": {
      "privateKey": string, // you use this to create signatures on requests
      "publicKey": string, // subjects use this to verify your signatures on requests
    }, "encryption": {
      "privateKey": string, // you use this to decrypt presentations you receive from subjects
      "publicKey": string, // subjects use this to encrypt presentations they send to you
    }
  }
  // highlight-end
}
```

---

### `sendRequest`
> Create a <Tip type="request"/> to be displayed or sent to a <Tip type="subject"/>.

You need to provide:

1. your verifier <Tip type="DID"/> 
2. your verifier signing private key
3. <Tip type="holder app"/> UUID
4. credential request(s)

The first two are returned by [`registerVerifier`](#registerverifier). The third (holder app UUID) identifies the mobile app users will share <Tip type="presentation">presentations</Tip> from. For example, Hooli FinTech might use the UUID for ACME Bank's mobile app, so the user is prompted to share a presentation from that app.

The fourth (credential requests) encodes which <Tip type="credential">credentials</Tip> you're asking the user to include in a presentation. It's a list of one or more [`CredentialRequest`](https://docs.unum.id/types/interfaces/credentialrequest.html) objects (defined in the [Unum ID generic types project](https://github.com/UnumID/types/blob/00ba819e661e2856ba9909923ac6f083b9a15e85/index.d.ts#L113-L117)):

```typescript title="CredentialRequest"
{
  type: string; // credential type. This must match type of previously issued credential.
  issuers: string[]; // list of DIDs for acceptable issuers. If multiple, any one is acceptable.
  required?: boolean; // if credential is required (default is true)
}
```

If you list multiple <Tip type="issuer">issuers</Tip>, the user can include a credential issued by *any one* of those listed.

You can optionally provide:

5. expiration date
6. metadata

:::important
The private key *never* leaves your server. The Server SDK only needs it to perform cryptographic functions on your behalf.
:::

#### Parameters
```typescript
"verifier": string, // your verifier DID
"credentialRequests": CredentialRequest[], // a list of one or more CredentialRequest objects. Encodes which credentials should be included in presentation that responds to PresentationRequest.
"signingPrivateKey": string, // your verifier signing private key
"holderAppUuid": string, // identifies mobile app subjects will share presentations from
"expiresAt"?: string, // (optional) when PresentationRequest will no longer be valid (ISO 8601 date/time). Default is 10 minutes after creation.
"metadata"?: object // (optional) any additional data to include in PresentationRequest
```

#### Response Body: [`PresentationRequestResponse`](https://docs.unum.id/Server-SDK-Typescript/interfaces/presentationrequestresponse.html)
```typescript title="PresentationRequestResponse"
{
  "presentationRequest": {
    "uuid": string, // identifies PresentationRequest in Unum ID database
    "createdAt": string, // when PresentationRequest was created (ISO 8601 date/time)
    "updatedAt": string, // when PresentationRequest was last updated (ISO 8601 date/time). Should always be same as createdAt.
    "expiresAt": string, // when PresentationRequest will no longer be valid (ISO 8601 date/time)
    "verifier": string, // your verifier DID
    "credentialRequests": CredentialRequest[], // a list of one or more CredentialRequest objects. Encodes which credentials should be included in presentation that responds to PresentationRequest.
    "proof": Proof, // acryptographic proof created by signing PresentationRequest with your verifier signing private key. Can be used to verify PresentationRequest.
    "metadata": object // any additional data to include in PresentationRequest
  },
  "verifier": {
      "name": string, // human readable name for verifier. Displayed to users in mobile apps.
      "did": string, // your verifier DID
      "url": string // endpoint you use to receive presentations
  },
  "issuers": {
      "IssuerDid:string": { // map keyed on issuer DID(s) that issued requested credential(s)
        "name": string, // human readable name for issuer
        "did": string // issuer DID
      }
  },
  /* You send this to a user with the Web SDK: */
  // highlight-next-line
  "deeplink": string, // deep link (URL) that can be used to trigger intended mobile app to load PresentationRequest

}
```

### `verifyPresentation`
> Verify <Tip type="presentation"/> shared by <Tip type="subject"/>.

You need to be able to receive presentations from users and pass them to this function. To do this, you need to create a `/presentation` endpoint that conforms to our [OpenAPI specification](https://unumid.postman.co/workspace/Unum-ID-Team-Workspace~48b1f312-a6e6-4bcc-86a0-aa4bc37df9b4/api/09ad0ccd-c614-4d54-a1b4-ff9ae85b8449?version=c217a461-fc05-4476-a792-6c9163f2a198&tab=define). The Unum ID cloud sends encrypted presentations to this endpoint, which should pass those presentations to the `verifyPresentation` function to be decrypted and verified.

You need to provide:

1. your verifier <Tip type="DID"/> 
2. your verifier encryption private key
3. encrypted presentation (received at `/presentation` endpoint)
4. (optional, but recommended) presentation request (received at `/presentation` endpoint)

The fist two are returned by [`registerVerifier`](#registerverifier).

:::important
Unum ID *never* has access to sensitive data contained in presentations. The [Mobile SDK](mobile-sdk-overview) encrypts each presentation (with your verifier encryption public key) before sending it to us. We have no ability to decrypt the data — only you do.
:::

:::note
`presentationRequest` is optional in order for the server sdk can handle verifying presentations that may not have a corresponding request. However, if `presentationRequest` is supplied from UnumID's SaaS via the `/presentation` endpoint, it is strongly recommended that it is provided as it performs additional validation checks on your behalf.
:::

#### Parameters
```typescript
"encryptedPresentation": EncryptedData, // encrypted presentation
"verifierDid": string, // your verifier DID
"encryptionPrivateKey": string // your verifier encryption private key
"presentationRequest"?: PresentationRequestDto // (optional) presentation request dto object to verify presentation credentials meet request requirements. This is an optional param to support the future use case of handling verifying presentations that are not in response to PresentationRequest
```

#### Response Body: [`DecryptedPresentation`](https://docs.unum.id/Server-SDK-Typescript/interfaces/decryptedpresentation.html)
```typescript title="DecryptedPresentation"
{
  "isVerified": boolean; // whether the presentation is valid
  "type": 'VerifiablePresentation' | 'DeclinedPresentation' // type of presentation. DeclinedPresentation means user declined request and the submitted presentation's VerifiableCredential attribute was undefined or an empty array.
  "presentation": Presentation, // decrypted Presentation object
  "message"?: string; // (optional) included if isVerified is false. Explains why verification failed.
}
```

You can decide what to do with the result of the verification. We recommend that you require that `isVerified` must be `true`, but depending on your use case you may want to handle this case differently. 

---

### `sendSms`
*This is a utility function you won't usually need. For most use cases, the [Web SDK](/web-sdk) or a separate service of your choice will handle sending SMS messages. But you can use this function if helpful.*

> Send an SMS containing a deep link to a <Tip type="subject"/>.

Messages you send will (necessarily) be delivered from an Unum ID associated phone number, but this association won't be visible to the user. You can of course use your own SMS sending service if you prefer.

To request a <Tip type="presentation"/> from a user, you need to:

1. create the <Tip type="request"/> object using [`sendRequest`](#sendrequest), which includes a deep link that references the request
2. send or display the deep link to the user

SMS is one way to send the deep link. The SMS message will be in the format:
> Verification Request: [verifier_name]. Click here to complete: [deep_link]

:::note
The verifier is corresponding to the presentation request from which the deeplink references. Because you are the acting verifier, the name will be what ever you provided during [verifier registration](#registerverifier). 
:::

#### Parameters
```typescript
{
  "to": string, // phone number to send SMS to
  "deeplink": string // the deeplink corresponding to the presentation request you would like served to the user
}
```

#### Response Body: Empty
If unsuccessful, an exception will be thrown.
```typescript
{}
```

---

### `sendEmail`
*This is a utility function you won't usually need. For most use cases, the [Web SDK](/web-sdk) or a separate service of your choice will handle sending emails. But you can use this function if helpful.*

> Send an email containing a deep link to a <Tip type="subject"/>.

Emails you send will be delivered from no-reply@unum.id. You can of course use your own email sending service if you prefer.

To request a <Tip type="presentation"/> from a user, you need to:

1. create the <Tip type="request"/> object using [`sendRequest`](#sendrequest), which includes a deep link that references the request
2. send or display the deep link to the user

Email is one way to send the deep link. The email will be in the format:
>   - *subject:* Verification Request: [verifier_name]
  - *body:* Click here to complete: [deep_link]


:::note
The verifier is corresponding to the presentation request from which the deeplink references. Because you are the acting verifier, the name will be what ever you provided during [verifier registration](#registerverifier). 
:::

#### Parameters
```typescript
{
  "to": string, // email address to send email to
  "deeplink": string // the deeplink corresponding to the presentation request you would like served to the user
}
```

#### Response Body: Empty 
If unsuccessful, an exception will be thrown.
```typescript
{}
```
---
### `checkCredentialStatus`
Used to check the status of a credential. 

The `status` attribute of the response is of type [CredentialStatusOptions](https://docs.unum.id/types/modules.html#credentialstatusoptions). Currently the only valid status are: verified and revoked.

```typescript title="CredentialStatusOptions"
export type CredentialStatusOptions = 'valid' | 'revoked';
```

Parameters
```typescript
{
  "credentialId": string, // the id of the credential in question
}
```

#### Response Body: [`CredentialStatusInfo`](https://docs.unum.id/Server-SDK-Typescript/interfaces/credentialstatusinfo.html).
```typescript title="CredentialStatusInfo"
{
  "createdAt": Date; // the time  the credential was recorded as created in the UnumID SaaS db
  "updatedAt": Date; // the time  the credential was recorded as updated in the UnumID SaaS db
  "credentialId": string; // the did (aka id) of the credential this status is in regard to
  "status": CredentialStatusOptions; // a string literal type that currently only consists of 'valid' and 'revoked'
}
```
