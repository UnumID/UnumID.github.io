:::

1. ACME's server uses the [Server SDK](/server-sdk) to issue an authentication <Tip type="credential"/> to Richard.
2. Richard's ACME app uses the [Mobile SDK](/mobile-sdk-overview) to store the credentiaal.
3. ACME's server uses the Server SDK create a <Tip type="request"/> for a <Tip type="presentation"/> (of the credential).
4. ACME's website uses the [Web SDK](/web-sdk) to display or send the request to Richard.
5. Richard's ACME app uses the Mobile SDK to prompt Richard to respond to the request.
6. Richard agrees to authenticate, and his ACME app uses the Mobile SDK to send a presentation (of the credential) to ACME's server.
7. ACME's server uses the Server SDK to verify the presentation.
8. ACME's website uses the Web SDK to get the result of the verification and log Richard in.

### Instant Onboarding

In this example, **Hooli FinTech** uses Verified Inc. for instant onboarding. It uses **Richard's** **ACME** information (which he chooses to share) to create a pre-approved Hooli account for him.

:::

1. Hooli's server uses the [Server SDK](/server-sdk) create a <Tip type="request"/> for a <Tip type="presentation"/> (of the ACME KYC verification <Tip type="credential"/>).
2. Hooli's website uses the [Web SDK](/web-sdk) to display or send the request to Richard.
3. Richard's ACME app uses the [Mobile SDK](/mobile-sdk-overview) to prompt Richard to respond to the request.
4. Richard agrees to share his information, and his ACME app uses the Mobile SDK to send a presentation (of the ACME KYC verification credential) to Hooli's server.
5. Hooli's server uses the Server SDK to verify the presentation.
6. Hooli's website uses the Web SDK to get the result of the verification and create an account for Richard with the ACME information he shared.
