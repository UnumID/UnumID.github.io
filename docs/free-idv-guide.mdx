## Motivations

Unum ID is willing to cover your identity verification costs in order to create a truly win-win-win scenario for you, your partners, and your users. Simply put, you issue a digital ID card to any of your users (new or existing) with verified identity data, and we pay you for it. The core motivations for such an arraignment are multifaceted: 

1. **You get your identity verification costs covered** with any provider(s) of your choosing
2. **You get a new revenue stream** when the user uses your verified data to onboard with [1-click](https://www.unumid.co/1-click)
3. **Your users get to enjoy 1-click onboarding** with any of your partners or other third parties that accept your verified data, which also means increased brand awareness
4. **Unum ID gets more identity into the identity network**, which is why we are willing to subsidize your costs

## UX Strategies
There are many user experiences that can be implemented to leverage the Free IDV offering. Below are just a few recommendations with an accompanying demo of each.

- Next User Sign In
<details>

## Implementation

The implementation goal is to **issue <Tip type="credential">credentials</Tip> to a user.** When you do, Unum ID will pay you according to your contract. The steps for completing the implementation are as follows:

1. **Get user consent.** Ask the user if they want to activate their digital ID card (from your brand), and include Unum ID legal language:

> By clicking the button below, you agree to Unum ID’s <a href="https://www.unumid.co/legal/terms-of-use">Terms of Use</a> and direct YOUR_COMPANY_NAME to share your personal information with Unum ID to provide its digital ID card services, in accordance with its <a href="https://www.unumid.co/legal/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a>.

"Terms of Use" should be underlined or colored and hyperlinked to <a href="https://www.unumid.co/legal/terms-of-use">`https://www.unumid.co/legal/terms-of-use`</a>. "Privacy Policy" should be underlined or colored and hyperlinked to <a href="https://www.unumid.co/legal/privacy-policy">`https://www.unumid.co/legal/privacy-policy`</a>.

:::info
**You must obtain user consent before issuing credentials.** Not doing so violates our terms and will prevent us from paying you for issuing credentials. 
:::

2. **Call [`/credentials`](/api-overview#issue-credentials)** with the user's verified email and/or phone and one or more credentials. For each credential, include a `type` and `data` in accordance with one of our [schemas](/schema). 

_If we don't have a schema that suits your needs, [email us](mailto:support@unumid.co) and we'll make one for you._

:::caution
**When issuing credentials, you must only use an email or phone that you've verified.** This is to ensure that only the controller of that email or phone can access the credentials you issue to them.
:::

For example, if you have a verified Social Security Number (SSN) for a user, you can issue them a `SsnCredential`. Just call the `/credentials` endpoint with the user's email and/or phone, the `SsnCredential` type, and the SSN data:

```json title="Example Issue Credentials Request Body"
{
  "email": "test@example.com",
  "phone": "+10123456789",
  "credentials": [
    {
      "type": "SsnCredential",
      // based on the properties attribute of the schema
      // highlight-start
      "data": {
        "ssn": "111-22-3333"
      },
      // highlight-end
      "expirationDate": 1893484800
    }
  ]
}
```

Format the credential data according to the `properties` attribute of the credential schema. In this case, the schema is for a `SsnCredential` which can found found at [`https://schema.unumid.co/jsonSchema/SsnCredential`](https://schema.unumid.co/jsonSchema/SsnCredential). 

More information about credential schemas can be found in the [Schema](/schema) section.
