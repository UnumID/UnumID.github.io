This section will hopefully answer any questions you have about Unum ID. If you have any other questions, please contact us at support@unumid.co.

<details>
  <summary>
    <b>Do we have to replace our account opening or identity verification system?</b>
  </summary>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b>No.</b> Unum ID can sit on top of your existing account onboarding
    system, allowing you to continue to use any KYC or identity verification
    provider you like.
  </p>
</details>
<br />
<details>
  <summary>
    <b>Are there setup steps for users?</b>
  </summary>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b>No, for users everything works automatically, behind the scenes.</b> When
    you set up Unum ID you opt to create credentials for existing or new users -
    either way it is a button click for the user. With that button click they
    will have all the convenience of instant onboarding Unum ID provides without
    having to do anything further. Additionally your business stands to gain the
    long term benefit of increased revenue every time the user leverages their
    credentials from you.

  <summary>
    <b>What if a user loses their phone or access to their email?</b>
  </summary>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b>Not a problem.</b> The user's credentials are securely stored in the
    cloud and can be retrieved via email or phone verification on any device
    upon authentication in any browser to our wallet.
  </p>
</details>
<br />

<details>
  <summary>
    <b>Can Unum ID be used as a means of authentication?</b>
  </summary>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b>Yes.</b> Unum ID can sit on top of your existing account authorization
    system, facilitating a gradual transition away from passwords. You donâ€™t
    have to eliminate them right away, or ever if you prefer.
  </p>
  <p>
    We recommend first using Unum ID as a second step in the authentication
    process, on top of your existing account system. Then, you can gradually
    replace that system entirely to fully eliminate passwords and remove the
    weak link.
  </p>
  <p>
    Even though this use case is viable, please reach out for more detailed
    information as we are no longer publicly promoting this use case.
