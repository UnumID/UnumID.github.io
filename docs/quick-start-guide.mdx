*Get started with an Unum ID deployment.*

This guide provides an abbreviated step-by-step guide for how to get setup as an Unum ID Issuer and/or Verifier. For full technical details, see the documentation for each component.

## Dashboard Access
The Unum ID Dashboard is a tiered permissions, self-service portal where one can manage their organization's API Keys and view their usage statistics. To gain access:

1. Go to the Unum ID [dashboard](https://dashboard.unumid.co/).

2. In order to sign up to use the dashboard you will need to create an Unum ID Wallet account. Initiate the sign up flow by scanning the QR code found on the login page with your mobile device.

3. After creating an Unum ID Wallet account you can use it to login into the dashboard by scanning the QR code again and completing the presentation share prompts. 

## API Keys
Once you have access to the Dashboard you can create and manage Issuer and Verifier API Keys. To create an API Key:

1. Navigate to the Entities tab on the Company page.

2. Click "Create Issuer" or "Create Verifier" to create an API Key for one or the other respectively. The Verifier API Key only requires a name. The Issuer API Key requires a name and a card imagine. The card image is displayed in Users' wallets when they hold credentials from you or your credentials are being requested.

## Server SDK
After creating an Issuer and/or Verifier API Key you will need to leverage it in the [Server SDK](https://github.com/UnumID/server-sdk-typescript). Registration via the Server SDK is required to be in your application because of the generation of sensitive private signing and encryption keys. You will also need to a persisted data store accessible. To properly register:

### Node.js
1. If using Node.js, install the SDK [module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@unumid/server-sdk) using `npm i @unumid/server-sdk`.

### Other Runtime Languages 
If using a different runtime language, you can use the SDK via HTTP. To deploy the [Issuer-Verifier](https://github.com/UnumID/issuer-verifier-app) HTTP wrapper project:

1. Go to the open source Issuer-Verifier Github [repo](https://github.com/UnumID/issuer-verifier-app).

2. Pull the project and deploy it along side your other apps using whatever method you are most comfortable with. The project contains a Dockerfile and as well as a CircleCI CD config file for automated deployments.

*Coming Soon: Publicly accessible docker image repository.*

:::note
An example demo project that interfaces with the SDK over HTTP is the [Developer Demo](/developer-demo).

#### Register Issuer
Once the Server SDK is accessible and there is a persisted data store available, you can register an Issuer:

1. Use the module's [registerIssuer](https://docs.unumid.co/server-sdk#registerissuer) method with your respective API Key.

```typescript title="Example registerIssuer"
const response = await registerIssuer('U7nbHmEpmZuRZMTA2ItFltan64SGKoDLYn7cMnpe4w2=', 'https://api.acme.com');
```

2. The resultant private signing and encryption key need to be persisted along with the DID.

3. Create the `/userCredentialRequests` endpoint adhering to the OpenApi [specification](https://gist.github.com/UnumIDMachine/146a0a428c683b756efd8240b31a4678) to receive signed <Tip type="subject"/> credential requests and user <Tip type="DID"/> information from Unum ID. Examples of this can be found in our Demo applications.

#### Register Verifier
Once the Server SDK is accessible and there is a persisted data store available, you can register a Verifier:

1. Use the SDK's [registerVerifier](https://docs.unumid.co/server-sdk#registerverifier) method with your respective API Key.

```typescript title="Example registerVerifier"
const response = await registerVerifier('0Hner7ibF/aHWLBvUyY4iDJ1xymbef0lzMxiS0eTGoS=', 'https://api.acme.com');
```

2. The resultant private signing and encryption key need to be persisted along with the DID.

3. Create the `/presentation` endpoint adhering to the OpenApi [specification](https://gist.github.com/UnumIDMachine/a2d71f12b0596a62c9dcc4de7a255f4f) for receiving encrypted <Tip type="presentation"/> data from our Identity Engine cloud. Examples of this can be found in our Demo applications.

## Issue Credentials
Once you have registered an Issuer, stored the resultant private signing and encryption keys along with the DID, and have the `/userCredentialRequests` you can issue credentials to Unum ID users. However users must also have a DID and key pairs to properly receive (and eventually share) encrypted credentials. They need to have their Unum ID Wallet setup. To get associate a user with a DID and prompt them to create a wallet you will need to:

### Associate Users with Unum ID DIDs
1. Create and persist a unique, short-lived, one-time-use `userCode` along side your User Entity.

2. Redirect to the Unum ID Wallet url https://wallet.unumid.co/authenticate while providing the userCode value as a query param along with your Issuer DID. For example:

```
https://wallet.unumid.co/authenticate?userCode=f85fc85b-7467-4b3f-8581-f138d8b4798g&issuer=did:unum:8b642752-aa85-491a-80d3-cd6c0ef9426n
```

3. This will prompt the individual to verify their email address, perform a biometric, and create a wallet. The result of this will be a call back to your provided issuer URL on the `/userCredentialRequests` endpoint with the `userDidAssociation` attribute populated containing the `userCode` along with newly created `DID`.

4. Store the associated `DID` in the callback response along side your User entity. The used `userCode` attribute should be deleted from the User entity as well.

### Giving Users Credentials
1. Now that the User has a DID you can use the SDK's [issueCredentials](https://docs.unumid.co/server-sdk#issuecredentials) method to issue credentials to the User. For example: 

```typescript title="Example issueCredentials"
const result: UnumDto<CredentialPb> = await issueCredentials(
      'Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6ImFjY2VzcyJ9.eyJ1dWlkIjoiODg1ZDQxZjktYWFiNS00YTQ1LWE2ZTUtYWY1NjM1YjlkNGI5IiwiZGlkIjpudWxsLCJlbWFpbCI6InJheSs4MDAwQHVudW1pZC5jbyIsImlhdCI6MTY1NDMwODUxNCwiZXhwIjoxNjYyOTQ4NTE0LCJhdWQiOiJsb2NhbGhvc3QiLCJpc3MiOiJmZWF0aGVycyIsInN1YiI6Ijg4NWQ0MWY5LWFhYjUtNGE0NS1hNmU1LWFmNTYzNWI5ZDRiOSIsImp0aSI6ImJjOTNjNGMyLTg5NDQtNDMxYS1iZTY5LTQ2ZjBjNDA2MjBjYSJ9.zS5ZWBxjotHpuBHUN3pDn8J8ygDFYGD3ASmJVYSt7Wc',
      'did:unum:8b642752-aa85-491a-80d3-cd6c0ef9426n',
      'did:unum:a0cd2e20-5f3e-423c-8382-afc722eaca9e',
      [{
          'type': 'SsnCredential',
          'ssn': '123-45-5678
      }],
      '-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nMIGHAgEAMBMGByqGSM49AgEGCCqGSM49AwEHBG0wawIBAQQgw7wRQL1EUsLk08auyjhlHV0atw0wqQGjtP3wkAIz8uChRANCAARfUK8OjrArOokLQau9W3siHlxxtt9/FGjdiiL1YM8PqHqhmgscc6oSdUUKfA/HZaf9m2yEQqQPyoFR1R16Ck/8\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----'
    );
```

## Requesting Credentials
Once you have registered a Verifier, you can make a request for credentials. There is no requirement to issue Credential in order to request credentials. 

### React

1. If using React, install the [Web SDK](https://github.com/UnumID/web-sdk-react) React [module](npm install @unumid/web-sdk-react), `npm install @unumid/web-sdk-react`.

2. Use to create and display Presentation Requests.
