You will need an API key and an email and/or phone for each user. The easiest way to start is using our examples:

```json title="Sandbox API Key"
5YugDQgjPn2LG2xTAs/+c6Kfrf7Ie45PIGjJurP8vNk=
```
```json title="Sandbox User Email"
test@example.com
```
```json title="Sandbox User Phone"
+11111111111
```

**[Unum ID](https://www.unumid.co)** enables 1-Click or Free ID Verification (IDV), powered by our digital ID cards. 

You can implement any of the following:
- **1-Click IDV only:** If a user has a digital ID card, they can verify with 1-Click. If they don't, you take them through your existing verification process (no change needed).

  <details>
    <summary>Demo of 1-Click Only:</summary>
    <p>
      This demo shows Kredita using 1-Click IDV when it's available. They collect email and phone from the user (Richard) and check if the user has matching credentials. The user does, so Kredita lets them verify with 1-Click.
    </p>

  </details>

- **Free IDV Only:** You issue a digital ID card to any of your users (new or existing), and we pay you for it.

  <details>
    <summary>Demo of Free Only:</summary>
    <p>
      This demo shows Hooli using Free IDV. Richard is a an existing, verified user. The next time he signs in, Hooli asks him if he wants to activate his Hooli digital ID card. When he clicks the Activate button, Hooli issues the card, and Unum ID pays.
    </p>

  </details>

- **Both:** If a user has a digital ID card, they can verify with 1-Click. If they don't, you take them through your existing verification process (no change needed) — _and at the end you issue them a digital ID card, and we pay you for it_. 

**What do you want to implement?**

<Tabs groupId="options" defaultValue="free">
  
<TabItem value="1-click" label="1-Click Only">

  **You need to check whether the user has matching <Tip type="credential">credentials</Tip>.** If they do, 1-Click IDV is available.

  1. **Call `/hasMatchingCredentials`** with the user's email and/or phone and the credential type(s) you need.

  <details>
    <summary>What counts as a match?</summary>
    <p>
      When you call <code>/hasMatchingCredentials</code>, you include one or more credential requests. For each credential requests, you specify:
      <ul>
        <li>
          the type
        </li>
        <li>
          (optional) which issuers are acceptable
        </li>
        <li>
          (optional) whether the credential is required
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      There's a match if, for each credential request for a required credential, the user has a credential of the correct type from an acceptable issuer.
    </p>
  </details>

    ```typescript title="Example Response Body"
    {
        "match": true,
        "url": "https://wallet-beta.unumid.co/request/9f2053fc-cc4c-41cb-8d14-7d3ccf6167eb"
    }
  ```
    
  The user will either have matching credentials, or they won't. If they do, continue to step (2). If they don't, you're done with Unum ID and should take the user through your existing verification flow.

  2. **Direct the user to the `url`** the response body contains. They will complete 1-Click IDV from there and then be redirected to your client via your callback URL.

  3. **Call `/sharedCredentials/{uuid}`** with the `sharedCredentialsUuid` the callback URL contains. The response body will contain the credentials the user agreed to share via 1-Click IDV.

  ```typescript title="Example Response Body"
  {
      "uuid": string // the sharedCredentialsUuid
      "credentials": [{
          "id": "8a1d4e35-413d-496b-b499-8810b55cfb5c",
          "type": "SsnCredential",
          "data": {
              "ssn": "111-22-3333"
          },
          "issuanceDate": "1671847264479",
          "expirationDate": "1871839024044",
          "issuer": "32ef9562-312d-4a8b-8f3e-ccb8df500b55",
      }],
      // user's email from input to /hasMatchingCredentials
      // only present if email was provided
      "email"?: string,
      // user's phone from input to /hasMatchingCredentials
      // only present if email was provided 
      "phone"?: string
  }
  ```

  It's easiest to extract the data from each credential using the corresponding [schema](/schema). The extracted data is verified according to the issue of the credential, but you can perform additional verification steps if you like.

  **_✅ You're done!_**

<TabItem value="free" label="Free Only">

  **You need to issue <Tip type="credential">credentials</Tip> to a user.** When you do, Unum ID will pay you according to your contract.

  1. **Get user consent.** Ask the user if they want to activate their digital ID card (from your brand), and include Unum ID legal language:

  > By activating, you agree to Unum ID's <a href="https://www.unumid.co/legal"><u>Terms of Use</u></a>.

  "Terms of Use" should be underlined and hyperlinked to <a href="https://www.unumid.co/legal">`https://www.unumid.co/legal`</a>.

  :::info
  **You must obtain user consent before issuing credentials.** Not doing so violates our terms and will prevent us from paying you for issuing credentials. 
  :::

  2. **Call `/credentials`** with the user's verified email and/or phone and one or more credentials. For each credential, include a `type` and `data` in accordance with one of our [schemas](/schema). 

  _If we don't have a schema that suits your needs, [email us](mailto:support@unumid.co) and we'll make one for you._

  :::caution
  **When issuing credentials, you must only use an email or phone that you've verified.** This is to ensure that only the controller of that email or phone can access the credentials you issue to them.
  :::

  For example, if you have a verified Social Security Number (SSN) for a user, you can issue them a `SsnCredential`. Just call the `/credentials` endpoint with the user's email and/or phone, the `SsnCredential` type, and the SSN data:

  ```json title="Example Issue Credentials Request Body"
  {
    "email": "test@example.com",
    "phone": "+11111111111",
    "credentials": [
      {
        "type": "SsnCredential",
        // based on the properties attribute of the schema
        // highlight-start
        "data": {
          "ssn": "111-22-3333"
        },
        // highlight-end
        "expirationDate": 1893484800
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

  Format the credential data according to the `json.properties` attribute of the credential schema. In this case, the schema is for a `SsnCredential` and is hosted at [`https://schema.unumid.co/jsonSchema/SsnCredential`](https://schema.unumid.co/jsonSchema/SsnCredential).
