## Introduction

Verified Inc. enables securely sharing verified <a href="/terminology#credential"><Tip type="credential"/></a> data amongst network participants. While in theory this data can take any shape, a structured schema must be defined and followed for every credential type for the sake of all network participants.

We use [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) syntax for data validation purposes via a pre-compiled [AJV](https://ajv.js.org/guide/why-ajv.html) engine. This ensures our credential schemas are robust enough to encapsulate any data while still being easily described, displayed, and validated.

### Schema Definitions

You can view all of the Verified Inc. defined credential schemas via https://schema.verified.inc/schema. If you want to know the schema for a particular credential type you can use that same url with the desired credential type in the path. For example, https://schema.verified.inc/schema/EmailCredential, would yield the EmailCredential's schema information.

:::tip
We have this API documented via our public [Postman collection](https://api.docs.verified.inc/) documentation under **Schema Resolver**.

It is possible to view the response bodies from https://schema.verified.inc/schema in the browser, but we recommend Postman, which automatically formats the JSON response for human readability.
:::

:::important
We hope to soon make it possible for you as a <a href="/terminology#customer"><Tip type="customer"/></a> to define your own credential schemas. But **currently, we Verified Inc. define all credential schemas.** If you would like a new credential schema for your use case, please let us know and we will gladly define one for you.
:::

We currently are opting to only support what can be referred to as "single attribute atomic credentials". This means that we break data into its simplest form for every credential. This is to provide users a means of selective disclosure for <a href="/terminology#request"><Tip type="request"/></a>s with optional fields.

#### JSON Schema
The `/schema` path will return enriched schema information. Likely the relevant section for your use is the `json` key, which contains the JSON schema definition.

Response body from https://schema.verified.inc/jsonSchema/AddressCredential:
```json title="Example AddressCredential Schema"
{
    // highlight-start
    "json": {
        "$id": "AddressCredential",
        "additionalProperties": false,
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "address": {
                "format": "address",
                "description": "Address in the format of: street, city, iso3166-code postal-code",
                "examples": [
                    "10 Downing Street, London, GB-ENG SW1A 2AA",
                    "307 3rd Ave, Apt #4, San Austin, US-GA 18025-9876"
                ],
                "type": "string"
            }
        },
        "required": [
            "address"
        ]
    },
    // highlight-end
    "jsonLD": {
        "@type": "AddressCredential",
        "address": "schema:address",
        "@context": "https://schema.unumid.co"
    },
    "attributes": {
        "type": "AddressCredential",
        "attributes": [
            {
                "key": "address",
                "label": "Address",
                "comment": "Physical address.",
                "displayFormat": "Address"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

You can instead just use the `/jsonSchema` path to only get that information, e.g. https://schema.verified.inc/jsonSchema/FirstNameCredential:
```json title="Example AddressCredential JSON Schema"
{
    "$id": "AddressCredential",
    "additionalProperties": false,
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "address": {
            "format": "address",
            "description": "Address in the format of: street, city, iso3166-code postal-code",
            "examples": [
                "10 Downing Street, London, GB-ENG SW1A 2AA",
                "307 3rd Ave, Apt #4, San Austin, US-GA 18025-9876"
            ],
            "type": "string"
        }
    },
    "required": [
        "address"
    ]
}
```

:::tip
Note that each attribute has a `description` and `examples` to help you understand the credential's schema. If you need more detailed information, look at our open source [schema-sdk](https://github.com/UnumID/schema-sdk) [formats](https://github.com/UnumID/schema-sdk/blob/main/src/formats.ts).

## Schema Library

Search for or select a schema, see its properties and attributes, and copy the schema JSON:

<Schemas/>

## Example

First, we get the JSON schemas for the [`AddressCredential`](https://schema.verified.inc/jsonSchema/AddressCredential), [`FirstNameCredential`](https://schema.verified.inc/jsonSchema/FirstNameCredential), and [`LastNameCredential`](https://schema.verified.inc/jsonSchema/LastNameCredential) and review their attributes' `description`s and `examples`.

Next, we construct valid credential bodies, according to the schemas:

```typescript
/*The credential data compliant with the Address, FirstName, and LastName Credentials schemas*/
const credentialsList: Credentials = [
  {
    type: 'AddressCredential',
    data: {
      address: '1010 Main St, San Francisco, US-CA 94117',
    },
  },
  {
    type: 'FirstNameCredential',
    data: {
      fullName: 'Richard',
    },
  },
  {
    type: 'LastNameCredential',
    data: {
      fullName: 'Hendricks',
    },
  }
];
```

```typescript title="Example Request Body for Issuing Credentials"
{
  "credentials": credentialsList, // a list of one or more Credentials objects
  "email": "richard.hendricks@pipedpiper.net"
}

```
