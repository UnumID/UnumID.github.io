The open source Hooli partner demo demonstrates an example implementation of the issuing partner Verified Inc. digital identity cards which redirects to Kredita. It is an application for a fictional customer, Hooli, which uses Verified Inc. to issue reusable <Tip type="credential">credentials</Tip> to its users and send them to the partner website.

Additional information on how to issue credentials with a partner can be found in the Guide's issuance with partner [documentation](/issuance-guide#partner-issuance).

## Web Demo
The live Hooli web application demo can be found [here](https://hooli-partner-web.demo.dev-verifiedinc.com/login). Its open source code can be found on [Github](https://github.com/UnumID/Hooli-Demo-Web).

Feel free to use a real email address that you control or our test account, richard@piedpiper.net. For the purposes of the demo, the password field is irrelevant. If then continuing to the [Kredita](/kredita-demo) demo it is important to use the same email there as the one used in Hooli. If opting to use the test account you can use the static OTP of `111111` to authenticate to the [wallet](https://wallet-beta.sandbox-verifiedinc.com/cards) - a necessary step in the Kredita demo.
