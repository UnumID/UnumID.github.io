import Tip from '../src/components/Tip';

The open source Hooli partner demo demonstrates an example implementation of the issuing partner Verified Inc. digital identity cards which then redirects to Kredita. It is an application for a fictional customer, Hooli, which uses Verified Inc. to issue reusable <Tip type="credential">credentials</Tip> to its users and send them to the partner url.

Additional information on how to issue credentials with a partner can be found in the Guide's issuance with partner [documentation](/issuance-guide#partner-issuance).

The live Hooli web application demo can be found [here](https://hooli-partner-web.demo.sandbox-verifiedinc.com/login). Its open source code can be found on [Github](https://github.com/UnumID/Hooli-Demo-Web).

Feel free to use a real email address that you control or our test account, richard@piedpiper.net. For the purposes of the demo, the password field is irrelevant. If opting to use the test account you can use the static OTP of `111111`.
