The Server SDK allows customer to secure and easy mange their keys and perform crypto graphic operations. Depending on if you are going to perform duties as an Issuer or Verifier your SDK usage will vary.

## Verifier
If you would like to act a <Tip type="verifier">Verifier</Tip> directly utilizing the Server SDK is no longer necessary. While it is still viable option for we now offer a more managed experience via our Verifier Service which drastically reduces the overhead to start requesting and receiving user data. We highly recommend it!

## Issuer
To perform the duties of an <Tip type="issuer">Issuer</Tip> we still require the Server SDK to be used on your backend and that you manage your own private keys.

*See detailed documentation for the [Verifier Service](/verifier-service) and [Server SDK](/server-sdk).*
