## Motivations

As a brand that issues credentials, Verified Inc. is willing to cover your identity verification costs in order to create a truly win-win-win scenario for you, your partners, and your users. Simply put, you issue a digital ID card to any of your users (new or existing) with verified identity data, and we pay you for it. The core motivations for such an arrangement are multifaceted: 

1. **You get your identity verification costs covered** with any provider(s) of your choosing.
2. **You get a new revenue stream** when the user uses your verified data to onboard with [1-Click](https://www.verified.inc/1-click).
3. **Your users get to enjoy 1-click onboarding** with any of your partners or other third parties that accept your verified data, which also means increased brand awareness through a delightful UX.
4. **Verified Inc. gets more identity into the identity network**, which is why we are willing to subsidize your costs.

## UX Strategies
There are many user experiences that can be implemented to seamlessly issue credentials to your users. Below are just a few recommendations with an accompanying demo of each.

- Next User Sign In

## Implementation

The implementation goal is to **issue <Tip type="credential">credentials</Tip> to a <Tip type="user">user</Tip>.** When you do, Verified Inc. will pay you according to your contract. The steps for completing the implementation are as follows:

1. **Get user consent.** Ask the user if they want to activate their digital ID card (from your brand), and include Verified Inc. legal language:

> By clicking the button below, you agree to Verified Inc.’s <a href="https://www.verified.inc/legal/terms-of-use">Terms of Use</a> and direct YOUR_COMPANY_NAME to share your personal information with Verified Inc. to provide its digital ID card services, in accordance with its <a href="https://www.verified.inc/legal/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a>.

"Terms of Use" should be underlined or colored and hyperlinked to <a href="https://www.verified.inc/legal/terms-of-use">`https://www.verified.inc/legal/terms-of-use`</a>. "Privacy Policy" should be underlined or colored and hyperlinked to <a href="https://www.verified.inc/legal/privacy-policy">`https://www.verified.inc/legal/privacy-policy`</a>.

:::info
**You must obtain user consent before issuing credentials.** Not doing so violates our terms and will prevent us from paying you for issuing credentials. 
:::

2. **Call [`/credentials`](/api-overview#issue-credentials)** with the user's verified email and/or phone and one or more credentials. For each credential, include a `type` and `data` in accordance with one of our [schemas](/schema). 

_If we don't have a schema that suits your needs, [email us](mailto:support@verified.inc) and we'll make one for you._

For example, if you have a verified Social Security Number (SSN) for a user, you can issue them a `SsnCredential`. Just call the `/credentials` endpoint with the user's email and/or phone, the `SsnCredential` type, and the SSN data:

```json title="Example Issue Credentials Request Body"
{
  "email": "test@example.com",
  "phone": "+10123456789",
  "credentials": [
    {
      "type": "SsnCredential",
      // based on the properties attribute of the schema
      // highlight-start
      "data": {
        "ssn": "111-22-3333"
      },
      // highlight-end
      "expirationDate": 1893484800
    }
  ]
}
```

Format the credential data according to the `properties` attribute of the credential schema. In this case, the schema is for a `SsnCredential` which can found found at [`https://schema.verified.inc/jsonSchema/SsnCredential`](https://schema.verified.inc/jsonSchema/SsnCredential). 

More information about credential schemas can be found in the [Schema](/schema) section.

✅ **_ You're done!_**

### Example & Demo

Please feel free to refer to the [open source](https://github.com/UnumID/Hooli-Demo-Web) Hooli [demo web app](https://hooli-web.demo.sandbox-verifiedinc.com/login) which demonstrates an example implementation of the Free IDV offering. More information, including mobile demo applications can also be found under the [Hooli Demo](/hooli-demo) section.

### Partner Issuance
In order to treat your users to a one-click partner onboarding experience immediately after issuing them credentials, you will need to pass your partner's static UUID. Upon doing so the issue [`/credentials`](/api-overview#issue-credentials) api response body will contain `partnerUrl` which you can then redirect your user to. This first directs the user to the Verified Inc. wallet where they can complete the partner onboarding process and are finally redirected to the partner's predefined post-signup url.

:::important
This use case of issuing credentials for a particular partner is by no means required. However, we have to capabilities to support this use case if you would like to provide this experience for your partners.
:::

:::note
To make this a very streamlined experience for the user, we include a pre-authenticated JWT in the url which will automatically log them into the Verified Inc. wallet. This JWT is valid for 5 minutes and is limited in scope to only the credentials you just issued the user. 

If the user does not complete the partner onboarding process within 5 minutes, they can still complete it at a later point now that they have the credentials, but we will require them to authenticate into the Verified Inc. wallet to do so.
:::

If this is an experience you would like to provide for your partners immediately after credential issuance, please let us know so we can provide you with your partner's static UUID and enable this capability for your <Tip type="brand">brand</Tip>.
