## Overview

**[Verified Inc.](https://www.verified.inc)** enables brands to provider their users with best in class onboarding with partners. This particular guide only focuses on how and why to become a <Tip type="brand">brand</Tip> that issues Verified Inc. <Tip type="credential">credentials</Tip>.

> By issuing credentials your brand can unlock Free IDV. Please see the Use Case [section](/1-click-or-free-use-case) for more information.

:::tip
You will need an API key and an email and/or phone for each user. Below is a valid API Key and URL for your initial usage along with suggested test email and phone values.

If you use these suggested test email and/or phone values you can authenticate to the wallet using those values, i.e. richard@piedpiper.net, using a static OTP of `111111`.

## Motivations

As a brand that issues credentials, Verified Inc. is willing to cover your identity verification costs in order to create a truly win-win-win scenario for you, your partners, and your users. Simply put, you issue a digital ID card to any of your users (new or existing) with verified identity data, and we pay you for it. The core motivations for such an arrangement are multifaceted: 

1. **You get your identity verification costs covered** with any provider(s) of your choosing.
2. **You get a new revenue stream** when the user uses your verified data to onboard with [1-Click](https://www.verified.inc/1-click).
3. **Your users get to enjoy 1-click onboarding** with any of your partners or other third parties that accept your verified data, which also means increased brand awareness through a delightful UX.
4. **Verified Inc. gets more identity into the identity network**, which is why we are willing to subsidize your costs.

## UX Strategies
There are many user experiences that can be implemented to seamlessly issue credentials to your users. Below are just a few recommendations with an accompanying demo of each.

- Next User Sign In
<details>

## Implementation

The implementation goal is to **issue <Tip type="credential">credentials</Tip> to a <Tip type="user">user</Tip>.** When you do, Verified Inc. will pay you according to your contract. The steps for completing the implementation are as follows:

#### 1. Get User Consent

You must **get user consent.** Ask the user if they want to activate their digital ID card (from your brand), and include Verified Inc. legal language:

> By clicking the button below, you agree to Verified Inc.’s <a href="https://www.verified.inc/legal/terms-of-use">Terms of Use</a> and direct YOUR_COMPANY_NAME to share your personal information with Verified Inc. to provide its digital ID card services, in accordance with its <a href="https://www.verified.inc/legal/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a>.

"Terms of Use" should be underlined or colored and hyperlinked to <a href="https://www.verified.inc/legal/terms-of-use">`https://www.verified.inc/legal/terms-of-use`</a>. "Privacy Policy" should be underlined or colored and hyperlinked to <a href="https://www.verified.inc/legal/privacy-policy">`https://www.verified.inc/legal/privacy-policy`</a>.

:::info
**You must obtain user consent before issuing credentials.** Not doing so violates our terms and will prevent us from paying you for issuing credentials. 
:::

#### 2. Issue Credentials

**Call [`/credentials`](/api-overview#issue-credentials)** with the user's verified email and/or phone and one or more credentials. For each credential, include a `type` and `data` in accordance with one of our [schemas](/schema). 

_If we don't have a schema that suits your needs, [email us](mailto:support@verified.inc) and we'll make one for you._

For example, if you have a verified Social Security Number (SSN) for a user, you can issue them a `SsnCredential`. Just call the `/credentials` endpoint with the user's email and/or phone, the `SsnCredential` type, and the SSN data:

```json title="Example Issue Credentials Request Body"
{
  "email": "test@example.com",
  "phone": "+10123456789",
  "credentials": [
    {
      "type": "SsnCredential",
      // based on the properties attribute of the schema
      // highlight-start
      "data": {
        "ssn": "111-22-3333"
      },
      // highlight-end
      "expirationDate": 1893484800
    }
  ]
}
```

Format the credential data according to the `properties` attribute of the credential schema. In this case, the schema is for a `SsnCredential` which can found found at [`https://schema.verified.inc/jsonSchema/SsnCredential`](https://schema.verified.inc/jsonSchema/SsnCredential). 

More information about credential schemas can be found in the [Schema](/schema) section.

✅ **_ You're done!_**

### Example & Demo

Please feel free to refer to the [open source](https://github.com/UnumID/Hooli-Demo-Web) Hooli [demo web app](https://hooli-web.demo.sandbox-verifiedinc.com/login) which demonstrates an example implementation of the Free IDV offering. More information, including mobile demo applications can also be found under the [Hooli Demo](/hooli-demo) section.

### Partner Issuance
#### First Time Issuance
Some issuance calls can be made with a particular partner in mind, i.e. in a promotional flow. In these cases you have already authenticated the user and would like to issue them credentials for a particular partner.

In this case, your partner's static `partnerUuid` can be provided to the issue [`/credentials`](/api-overview#issue-credentials) call. The resulting api response body will contain `partnerUrl` which you should redirect the user to. 
This url ultimately redirects the user to a page of the partners choosing. However, the url first directs the user to the Verified Inc. wallet where they explicity consent to the data share to the partner.

```json title="Example Issue Credentials Response"
{
    "email": "richard@pipedpiper.net",
    "partnerUrl": "https://wallet.verifiedinc.com/request/dfb39a34-ea90-4976-a230-12005c0ddfbb?email=richard%40pipedpiper.net&redirectUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fkredita-web.demo.sandbox-verifiedinc.co%2Fregister&jwt=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6ImFjY2VzcyJ9.eyJicmFuZFV1aWQiOiI0NDFhNmI2Yy03YjQ5LTRkNTUtYWExMC01ZWMzOWRlNjdjNjEiLCJjcmVkZW50aWFsSWRzIjpbImViNzNiYTBjLTY0MWUtNDc4Zi04ZGJkLWM4NjgzMjU2YWNmMSJdLCJ0aWVyIjoxMCwiaWF0IjoxNjg0NTE2NDU4LCJleHAiOjE2ODQ1MTcwNTgsImF1ZCI6Imh0dHA6Ly9sb2NhbGhvc3QiLCJzdWIiOiJjNThkYzc2MS1hNDhjLTRmYWQtOGUyMy1iYmIwMDBjYWIyNTUiLCJqdGkiOiJjYmNmYmVlZC01ZGY1LTQ5YjItOGRlNC1jMzFjYjA5MmYzNTUifQ.QSqg2kNTfnlh42qh0VYhT0Wz_ogSNMTfudNaDQyVIiQ",
    "credentials": [{...},{...}]
}
```

:::important
This use case of issuing credentials for a particular partner is by no means required. The key difference in this flow is the user can skip authenticating with the Verified Inc wallet to share their data.
:::

:::note
To make this a very streamlined experience for the user, we include a pre-authenticated JWT in the url which will automatically log them into the Verified Inc. wallet. This JWT is valid for 5 minutes and is limited in scope to only the credentials you just issued the user. 

If the user does not complete the partner onboarding process within 5 minutes, they can still complete it at a later point now that they have the credentials, but we will require them to authenticate into the Verified Inc. wallet to do so.
:::

If this is an experience you would like to provide for your partners immediately after credential issuance, please let us know so we can provide you with your partner's static UUID and enable this capability for your <Tip type="brand">brand</Tip>.

#### Already Issued Credentials
If you have already issued credentials to a user, then [`/hasMatchingCredentials`](/api-overview#check-user-credentials) can be called with `partnerUuid`. In this case, if Verified Inc. can confirm the user has credentials to satisfy the credential request(s) in the request body, then the resulting API response body will contain a `url` which you should redirect the user to. 
Just like the `partnerUrl`, this `url` ultimately redirects the user to a page of the partner's choosing. However, the `url` first directs the user to the Verified Inc. wallet, where they explicitly consent to share credential data with the partner.

```json title="Example Check has Matching Credentials Response"
{
    "match": "true",
    "url": "https://wallet.verifiedinc.com/request/dfb39a34-ea90-4976-a230-12005c0ddfbb?email=richard%40pipedpiper.net&redirectUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fkredita-web.demo.sandbox-verifiedinc.co%2Fregister&jwt=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6ImFjY2VzcyJ9.eyJicmFuZFV1aWQiOiI0NDFhNmI2Yy03YjQ5LTRkNTUtYWExMC01ZWMzOWRlNjdjNjEiLCJjcmVkZW50aWFsSWRzIjpbImViNzNiYTBjLTY0MWUtNDc4Zi04ZGJkLWM4NjgzMjU2YWNmMSJdLCJ0aWVyIjoxMCwiaWF0IjoxNjg0NTE2NDU4LCJleHAiOjE2ODQ1MTcwNTgsImF1ZCI6Imh0dHA6Ly9sb2NhbGhvc3QiLCJzdWIiOiJjNThkYzc2MS1hNDhjLTRmYWQtOGUyMy1iYmIwMDBjYWIyNTUiLCJqdGkiOiJjYmNmYmVlZC01ZGY1LTQ5YjItOGRlNC1jMzFjYjA5MmYzNTUifQ.QSqg2kNTfnlh42qh0VYhT0Wz_ogSNMTfudNaDQyVIiQ",
}
```

#### Recommended Implementation
We recommend that you first check internally whether you've issued credentials to a user. If you have, then call [`/hasMatchingCredentials`](/api-overview#check-user-credentials) to confirm with Verified Inc. that the user still has these credentials. (There are cases where the user will _not_ still have the credentials, for example if they went directly to their Verified Inc. wallet to delete them.) If the user does not still have the credentials, you can issue them new credentials, as long as you have their consent. As a precaution, you can also [patch](api-overview#patch-credentials) existing credentials with a status of `revoked` to ensure that only the new credentials you issue will be valid for use.
