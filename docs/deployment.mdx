Deploying Unum ID is straightforward.

# Components

Unum ID uses a hybrid deployment model. We provide several lightweight
SDKs that you install aand use to interact with our Identity Engine cloud.
These SDKs are:
- **Mobile SDK:** This works behind the scenes in your mobile app to 
securely store a user’s credentials. It also lets a user respond to 
requests for and share those credentials.
  - <u>iOS</u>: written in Swift, supports Swift and Objective-C apps, 
  iOS 11.1+, iPhone 6+
  - <u>Android</u>: supports Kotlin and Java apps, API Level 23+ (Android 6.0+)
  - ~480 KB
- **Server SDK:** ​This lets you issue credentials to a user, encrypted so that 
only their app can decrypt it. It also lets you verify that credentials a 
user shares are valid.
  - <u>Option 1​</u>: Node.js SDK (contact us for other languages)
  - <u>Option 2​</u>: containerized app with exposed API
- **Web SDK:** ​This lets you display requests for credentials to a user and show the results of
verifying credentials they share.
  - React library (contact us for other frameworks)
