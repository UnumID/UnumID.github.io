Our [Encrypted Domain](#encrypted-domain) approach ensures that:
- **We ​never ​have access to ​*any* ​sensitive user data.** 
- **The user has full control over their data.**
- **The user’s data is robustly tied back to a single human being.** 

We accomplish this with a state-of-the-art *​distributed* system — not a massive central database vulnerable to attack and privacy violations. This is the real magic of Unum ID.

## Encrypted Domain

![](/img/architecture.png)
*<b>Encrypted Domain:</b> You use SDKs to interact with our Identity Engine cloud. We *never* have access to sensitive user data. See the [Architecture](/architecture) section for more information about each component.*

A user’s Unum ID <Tip type="credential">credentials</Tip> are stored locally on their device, in an app using our [Mobile SDK](/mobile-sdk-overview). The *only* ones who ever have access to the sensitive data in each credential are:
1. the company that issued the credential
2. the user the credential was issued to
3. companies the user shares the credential with

The upshot is this: **Unum ID coordinates sharing of verified identity data, but we are *never* able to interact with that data in plaintext.** Our sharified identity™ solutions come with unparalleled privacy and security.

### Example

#### Issuing a Credential

 When you issue (send) a <Tip type="credential"/> to a user, that credential is encrypted with the user’s public key. (The [Server SDK](/server-sdk) does this locally on your server and sends the encrypted version to us.) We temporarily store and route the encrypted credential to the correct user’s app but have no ability to decrypt the data. The user’s app then receives and decrypts the credential. See the diagram below.

*<b>Issuance:</b> The Server SDK encrypts a credential with a user’s public key before sending it to us. This ensures that only you and that specific user have access to the plaintext data — Unum ID never does.*

#### Sharing a Credential

:::note
The shared credential is actually contained in a <Tip type="presentation"/> object, but this is unimportant jargon in this context. See the [Mobile SDK](/mobile-sdk-overview) and [Server SDK](/server-sdk) docs for full details.
:::

Then, when a user responds to a <Tip type="request"/> for a credential, that credential is encrypted with *your* public key.(The [Mobile SDK](/mobile-sdk) does this locally on the user’s device and sends the encrypted version to us.) We store nonsensitive metadata about the encrypted credential and route it to you, but we have no ability to decrypt the data. You then receive and decrypt the credential. See the diagram below.

*<b>Sharing:</b> The Mobile SDK encrypts a credential with your public key before sending it to us. This ensures that only the user and you have access to the underlying plaintext data — Unum ID never does.*

The encryption described above is ​*in addition to* the standard encryption like TLS that applies to all data in transit and at rest. This encryption is done with a specific public key and ensures only the holder of the corresponding private key can decrypt the data.

## Features

Unum ID solutions have best-in-class privacy and security features. Some of these are detailed below.

### Multi-Layer Encryption

Standard encryption like TLS applies to all data in transit and at rest, but there’s an additional layer. When you send a <Tip type="credential"/> to a user, it’s encrypted locally on your server such that only that user’s device can decrypt it (using your app). When the user shares the credential, it’s encrypted locally on their device (in your app) so that only the intended recipient can decrypt it. In other words, Unum ID coordinates sharing of verified identity data, but **​we *​never* h​ave access to sensitive data in plaintext.**

### Secure Mobile Hardware 

A user’s credentials are stored locally on their device, encrypted in your app. This is tied to the trusted execution environment (TEE) and secure hardware of the user’s phone so that the credentials can only be accessed or shared by passing a biometric or passcode check.

:::note
The secure hardware in a mobile device has the amazing property that an app can ask it to create key pairs and use the private keys *without ever directly accessing those private keys.* The private keys never leave the device, and even the manufacturer has no ability to access them.

Unum ID uses this to enable end-to-end public key cryptography. But, crucially, we package it behind a simple user experience so that users never need to even know what a public key is.
:::

### Privacy and Consent

Data is ​*only* ​shared with full consent of the user. Unum ID goes far beyond what’s needed for compliance with GDPR, CCPA, and other privacy regulations.

### Local Cryptography 

All cryptography (key generation, signing, encryption, etc.) is done locally, on your server or in your app on the user’s device. We provide software that makes this easy to do, but all operations are done independently of Unum ID. This ensures ​**your security is under your control.**

### No Shared Secrets

We use zero shared secrets: no passwords, passcodes, PINs, or otherwise. Unum ID instead uses **​public key cryptography** tied to the secure hardware of users’ phones. This completely eliminates common account takeover attacks like SIM swapping and behavioral fraud more generally. How? Because there’s no secret to intercept. See our white paper [​How Unum ID Stops Account Takeover​](https://www.unum.id/resources#white-papers) for more.

### Bi-Directional Auth

The security of our [​Passwordless Auth​](https://www.unum.id/solutions/passwordless-auth) solution applies to ​all ​interactions in Unum ID. This authentication is bi-directional: y​ou authenticate the user, ​and ​the user authenticates you! This eliminates phishing attacks because the user is unable to share data with anyone other than your company, no matter how convincing the phishing material may be.
