In order to become a customer and create Verifier and Issuer API keys for your brand you must reach out to support@unumid.co. _Our self service dashboard is coming soon!_

Please refer to detailed docs for the exact API calls to perform duties as an Issuer or Verifier, however both integration types require interfacing with the Unum ID public API. 

## Verifier
If you would like to act as a <Tip type="verifier">Verifier</Tip> you will need to interface with our Verifier Service API.

## Issuer
To perform the duties of an <Tip type="issuer">Issuer</Tip> you will need to interface with our Issuer Service API.

*See detailed documentation for the [Verifier Service](/verifier-service) and [Issuer Service](/issuer-service).*
