## Overview

**[Verified Inc.](https://www.verified.inc)** enables brands to provide their users with best in class onboarding. This particular guide focuses on how and why to become a <Tip type="brand">brand</Tip> that accepts Verified Inc. <Tip type="credential">credentials</Tip>.

> By accepting credentials your brand can unlock 1-Click on boarding. Please see the Use Case [section](/1-click-or-free-use-case) for more information.

:::tip
You will need an API key and an email and/or phone for each user. Below is a valid API Key and URL for your initial usage along with suggested test email and phone values.

If you use these suggested test email and/or phone values you can authenticate to the wallet using those values, i.e. richard@piedpiper.net, using a static OTP of `111111`.

## Motivations

As a brand that accepts digital ID cards, you can unlock 1-Click onboarding. This drastically decreases the abandonment rate during customer sign up and makes for a far better first touch experience for your new users.

Crucially, you will dramatically improve the experience for any user enabled with a digital ID card without changing the experience for any user without one. And because Verified Inc. sits on top of your existing onboarding process, you don’t need to change any existing security or compliance vendors or procedures.

Once you join, our team will identify opportunities to promote your brand within our network for 1-click conversions. These can be in-app offers, marketing emails, or similar promotions to drive users to your brand from complementary services.

In brief: As an acceptor in the Verified Inc. network, you will…

- Dramatically improve onboarding conversion.
- Delight users with a 1-click setup.
- Join a network of companies to help you grow faster.

## UX Strategies

You can check if a user has credentials in the background by calling [/hasMatchingCredentials](/api-overview#check-user-credentials) at any time. If the response contains `match`: `true` then you should redirect the user to the `url`. The demo below demonstrates an example UX.

<details>
  <summary>Demo Kredita Accepting Credentials</summary>
  <p>
    This demo shows Kredita accepting Hooli credentials in order to gain 1-Click
    IDV capabilities when it's available. They collect email and phone from the
    user (Richard) and check if the user has matching credentials. The user
    does, so Kredita lets them verify with 1-Click.

<details>
  <summary>Demo Brand Accepting Credentials via Partner Acceptance</summary>
  <p>
    This demo shows Lendtable accepting their partner, Hooli, credentials in
    order to gain 1-Click IDV capabilities. In this case Hooli can issue the
    credential in an on-demand fashion when the user clicks the button to redeem
    the Lendtable offer in the Hooli dashboard. This would ensure the user has
    the necessary credentials, so Lendtable can verify with 1-Click.

## Implementation

**You need to check whether the user has matching <Tip type="credential">credentials</Tip>.** If they do, they can share all of those credentials with 1-click.

#### 1. Check User Credentials

**Call [`/hasMatchingCredentials`](/api-overview/#check-user-credentials)** with the user's email and/or phone and the credential type(s) you need.

```typescript title="Example Response Body"
{
    "match": true,
    "url": "https://wallet.verified.inc/request/9f2053fc-cc4c-41cb-8d14-7d3ccf6167eb?email=test%40example.com&phone=%2B10123456789"
}
```

<details>
  <summary>What counts as a match?</summary>
  <p>
    When you call <code>/hasMatchingCredentials</code>, you include one or more
    credential requests. For each credential request, you specify:
    <ul>
      <li>the type</li>
      <li>(optional) which issuers are acceptable</li>
      <li>(optional) whether the credential is required</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    There's a match if, for each credential request for a required credential,
    the user has a credential of the correct type from an acceptable issuer.
  </p>
</details>
The user will either have matching credentials, or they won't. If they do, continue
to step (2). If they don't, you're done with Verified Inc. and should take the user
through your existing verification flow.

:::tip
If you would like your existing verification flow verification costs to be covered, please look into issuing credentials. More information can be found in the 1-Click or Free Use Case [section](/1-click-or-free-use-case).

#### 2. Redirect User to Verified Inc. Wallet

**Direct the user to the `url`** the response body contains. You need to add an additional `redirectUrl` query param that you define which will serve as the ultimate landing page after the user completes 1-Click IDV from the Verified Inc. web wallet.

For example, if the final url you need to redirect the user to is https://acme-bank.co/sign-up/complete then ultimate url you will redirect the user to will be something like this:

```text title="Example Redirect to Verified Inc. Wallet URL"
https://wallet.verified.inc/request/9f2053fc-cc4c-41cb-8d14-7d3ccf6167eb?email=test%40example.com&phone=%2B10123456789&redirectUrl=https://acme-bank.co/sign-up/complete
```

#### 3. Capture Query Param Value

**Capture the `sharedCredentialsUuid` query param** from the `redirectUrl` page you defined in step (2). To continue the example in step (2), the final url the user will be redirected to will be something like this:

```text title="Example Redirect Back to Acme Bank URL"
https://acme-bank.co/sign-up/complete?sharedCredentialsUuid=37ce0fff-af32-457e-9458-057125eb417d
```

#### 4. Retrieve Shared Credentials Data

**Call [`/sharedCredentials/{sharedCredentialsUuid}`](/api-overview#get-shared-credentials)** from your backend with the `sharedCredentialsUuid` the callback URL contains. The response body will contain the credentials the user agreed to share via 1-Click IDV.

```typescript title="Example Response Body"
{
    "uuid": string // the sharedCredentialsUuid
    "credentials": [
      {
        "id": "8a1d4e35-413d-496b-b499-8810b55cfb5c",
        "type": "SsnCredential",
        "data": {
            "ssn": "111-22-3333"
        },
        "issuanceDate": "1671847264479",
        "expirationDate": "1871839024044",
        "issuer": "32ef9562-312d-4a8b-8f3e-ccb8df500b55",
      },
      {
        "id": "1be7c008-3f0c-4a21-9aad-69ca1c4251d2",
        "type": "FullNameCredential",
        "issuer": "32ef9562-312d-4a8b-8f3e-ccb8df500b55",
        "issuanceDate": "1671847264479",
        "expirationDate": "1871839024044",
        "data": [
          {
            "id": "2e6a7b9a-e93e-43ba-98a9-c554f4e16457",
            "type": "FirstNameCredential",
            "issuer": "32ef9562-312d-4a8b-8f3e-ccb8df500b55",
            "issuanceDate": "1671847264479",
            "expirationDate": "1871839024044",
            "data": {
              "firstName": "Richard"
            }
          },
          {
            "id": "9a5817ef-e621-4277-8c48-c8ee3776b6c4",
            "type": "LastNameCredential",
            "issuer": "32ef9562-312d-4a8b-8f3e-ccb8df500b55",
            "issuanceDate": "1671847264479",
            "expirationDate": "1871839024044",
            "data": {
              "lastName": "Hendricks"
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    // user's email from input to /hasMatchingCredentials
    // only present if email was provided
    "email"?: string,
    // user's phone from input to /hasMatchingCredentials
    // only present if email was provided
    "phone"?: string
}
```

It's easiest to extract the data from each credential using the corresponding [schema](/schema). The extracted data is verified according to the issuer of the credential, but you can perform additional verification steps if you like.

✅ **_You're done!_**

### Partner Acceptance

In some cases, the issuer may issue credentials with you, the acceptor, as a specified partner, for example in a promotional flow. In these cases, as the accepting <Tip type="brand">brand</Tip>, you only need to handle steps ([3](acceptance-guide#3-capture-query-param-value)) and ([4](/acceptance-guide#4-retrieve-shared-credentials-data)) above.

To do this, the issuer specifies your brand `uuid` as the partner when issuing credentials to the user. This effectively ensures the user will have the necessary credentials, and it allows you to skip steps ([1](/acceptance-guide#1-check-user-credentials)). Because the user starts at the issuer in this type of flow, the issuer handles the redirect in step ([2](/acceptance-guide#2-redirect-user-to-verified-inc-wallet)). You must pre-define your desired `redirectUrl` with us. For more information, see the [partner issuance](/issuance-guide#partner-issuance) section of the issuance guide.

:::note
To enable this form of acceptance, we encode a direct relationship between the issuer and the acceptor. If you would like to implement this type of flow, please email us at contact@verified.inc so we can help you. However, please note this is not a requirement for acceptance.
