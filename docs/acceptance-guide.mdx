## Overview

**[Verified Inc.](https://www.verified.inc)** enables brands to provider their users with best in class onboarding. This particular guide focuses on how and why to become a <Tip type="brand">brand</Tip> that accepts Verified Inc. <Tip type="credential">credentials</Tip>.

> By accepting credentials your brand can unlock 1-Click on boarding. Please see the Use Case [section](/1-click-or-free-use-case) for more information.

:::tip
You will need an API key and an email and/or phone for each user. Below is a valid API Key and URL for your initial usage along with suggested test email and phone values.

If you use these suggested test email and/or phone values you can authenticate to the wallet using those values, i.e. richard@piedpiper.net, using a static OTP of `111111`.

## Motivations

As a brand that accepts digital ID cards, you can unlock 1-Click onboarding. This drastically decreases the abandonment rate during customer sign up and makes for a far better first touch experience for your new users.

Crucially, you will dramatically improve the experience for any user enabled with a digital ID card without changing the experience for any user without one. And because Verified Inc. sits on top of your existing onboarding process, you don’t need to change any existing security or compliance vendors or procedures.

Once you join, our team will identify opportunities to promote your brand within our network for 1-click conversions. These can be in-app offers, marketing emails, or similar promotions to drive users to your brand from complementary services.

In brief: As an acceptor in the Verified Inc. network, you will…
- Dramatically improve onboarding conversion.
- Delight users with a 1-click setup.
- Join a network of companies to help you grow faster.


## UX Strategies
The check to see if the user has credentials that you can accept can happen fully in the background by calling [/hasMatchingCredentials](/api-overview#check-user-credentials) at an opportune time. If the response is contains `match`: `true` then you will redirect to the Verified Inc. Wallet. The demo below demonstrates an example UX.

  <details>
    <summary>Demo Kredita Accepting Credentials</summary>
    <p>
      This demo shows Kredita accepting Hooli credentials in order to gain 1-Click IDV capabilities when it's available. They collect email and phone from the user (Richard) and check if the user has matching credentials. The user does, so Kredita lets them verify with 1-Click.

  <details>
    <summary>Demo Lendtable Accepting Credentials via Partner Dashboard</summary>
    <p>
      This demo shows Lendtable accepting their partner, Hooli, credentials in order to gain 1-Click IDV capabilities. In this case Hooli can issue the credential in an on-demand fashion when the user clicks the button to redeem the Lendtable offer in the Hooli dashboard. This would ensure the user has the necessary credentials, so Lendtable can verify with 1-Click.

## Implementation

**You need to check whether the user has matching <Tip type="credential">credentials</Tip>.** If they do, you can accept their credentials with the user consent at the click of button for the user. This is what we call 1-Click IDV.

1. **Call [`/hasMatchingCredentials`](/api-overview/#check-user-credentials)** with the user's email and/or phone and the credential type(s) you need.

```typescript title="Example Response Body"
{
    "match": true,
    "url": "https://wallet.verified.inc/request/9f2053fc-cc4c-41cb-8d14-7d3ccf6167eb?email=test%40example.com&phone=%2B10123456789"
}
```

<details>
  <summary>What counts as a match?</summary>
  <p>
    When you call <code>/hasMatchingCredentials</code>, you include one or more credential requests. For each credential request, you specify:
    <ul>
      <li>
        the type
      </li>
      <li>
        (optional) which issuers are acceptable
      </li>
      <li>
        (optional) whether the credential is required
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    There's a match if, for each credential request for a required credential, the user has a credential of the correct type from an acceptable issuer.
  </p>
</details>
  
The user will either have matching credentials, or they won't. If they do, continue to step (2). If they don't, you're done with Verified Inc. and should take the user through your existing verification flow. 

:::tip
If you would like your existing verification flow verification costs to be covered, please look into issuing credentials. More information can be found in the 1-Click or Free Use Case [section](/1-click-or-free-use-case).

2. **Direct the user to the `url`** the response body contains with an additional `redirectUrl` query param that you define which will serve as the ultimate landing page after the user completes 1-Click IDV from the Verified Inc. web wallet. For example the final url you need to redirect the user to is:

```text title="Example Redirect to Verified Inc. Wallet URL"
https://wallet.verified.inc/request/9f2053fc-cc4c-41cb-8d14-7d3ccf6167eb?email=test%40example.com&phone=%2B10123456789&redirectUrl=https://acme-bank.co/sign-up/complete
```

3. **Capture the `sharedCredentialsUuid` query param** from the `redirectUrl` page you defined in step (2). To continue the example in step (2), the final url the user will be redirected to will be something like this:

```text title="Example Redirect Back to Acme Bank URL"
https://acme-bank.co/sign-up/complete?sharedCredentialsUuid=37ce0fff-af32-457e-9458-057125eb417d
````

4. **Call `/sharedCredentials/{uuid}`** from your backend with the `sharedCredentialsUuid` the callback URL contains. The response body will contain the credentials the user agreed to share via 1-Click IDV.

```typescript title="Example Response Body"
{
    "uuid": string // the sharedCredentialsUuid
    "credentials": [{
        "id": "8a1d4e35-413d-496b-b499-8810b55cfb5c",
        "type": "SsnCredential",
        "data": {
            "ssn": "111-22-3333"
        },
        "issuanceDate": "1671847264479",
        "expirationDate": "1871839024044",
        "issuer": "32ef9562-312d-4a8b-8f3e-ccb8df500b55",
    }],
    // user's email from input to /hasMatchingCredentials
    // only present if email was provided
    "email"?: string,
    // user's phone from input to /hasMatchingCredentials
    // only present if email was provided 
    "phone"?: string
}
```

It's easiest to extract the data from each credential using the corresponding [schema](/schema). The extracted data is verified according to the issuer of the credential, but you can perform additional verification steps if you like.
