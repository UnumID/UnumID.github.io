Unum ID uses a few specialized terms and concepts:
- [credential](#credential)
- [presentation](#presentation)
- [request](#request)

## Credential

A **credential** is just a collection of data about a person, as verified
by an entity. For example, ACME Bank can create a credential containing
verified account information about Wile E. Coyote.

A credential has four basic elements:
- a type
- an identifier for the entity 
- an identifier for the person
- data about the person 
The data can be anything at all (any valid JSON) â€” contact information,
proof of government ID, medical data, etc.

A credential is cryptographically signed by the entity that creates it.
This allows a company who later receives it to verify that it's valid.

```json
{
  "@context": ["https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1"],
  "credentialStatus": {
    "createdAt": "2020-05-26T23:07:12.770Z",
    "status": "valid",
    "updatedAt": "2020-05-26T23:07:12.770Z",
    "uuid":"c3974fa3-396e-42ee-81a9-9ab69efce031"
  },
  "credentialSubject": {

    "value":"dummy value"
  },
  "id": "0c93beb0-2605-4650-b698-3fd92eb110b9",
  "issuanceDate": "2020-05-26T23:07:12.770Z",

  },
  "type":["VerifiableCredential","DummyCredential"]
}
```

## Presentation

A **presentation** is just a collection of one or more credentials. When
a user agrees to share data with a company, the mobile app they're using
creates a presentation and sends it to the company.

A presentation is cryptographically signed by the mobile app that creates 
it for the user. This allows a company who later receives it to verify that 
it's valid.

  "@context": ["https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1"],
  "type": ["VerifiablePresentation"],

    "proofPurpose": "assertionMethod"
  }
}
```

## Request 

A **request** is what a company creates to request a presentation (of
credentials) from a user.

A request has four basic elements:
- an identifier for the company 
- a list of requested credentials
For each credential, the request specifies which type it should be and
which entity should have created it. For example, Hooli FinTech can request
a KYC verification credential that was created by ACME Bank.

A request is cryptographically signed by the company that creates it.
This allows a user's mobile app to verify that it's valid.
