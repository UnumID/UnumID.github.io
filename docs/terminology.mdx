Unum ID uses a few specialized terms and concepts. It's not necessary to understand these in full detail, but knowing a little about them will help you deploy and use Unum ID tech.

:::tip
**We've included helpful tooltips** like <Tip text="Whoa, a tooltip! ðŸ˜Ž">this one</Tip> (hover over it) throughout the docs. These offer quick definitions, examples, and links to dive in deeper. Anytime you see an underline, hover over it to see the tooltip!

The tooltips you'll see most often refer to the terms described in this section (for example: <Tip type="credential"/>).
:::

**The [main terms](#main-terms) to know are:**

- **[credential](#credential)**
- **[presentation](#presentation)**
- **[request](#request)**
- **[user](#user)**

## Main Terms

### Credential

> A **credential** is a collection of data about a person. It's issued by a company (i.e. created and sent to a user) and stored in the company's app, on that user's device.

**Example:** ACME Bank issues a KYC verification credential to Richard (an ACME user). This includes Richard's contact information and account numbers, as well as a level of confidence in the accuracy of the data.

**Components:** A company issues credentials using the <a href="/server-sdk">Server SDK</a>, and an app stores credentials using the <a href="/mobile-sdk-overview">Mobile SDK</a>.

At a high level, to issue a credential a company inputs four pieces of information (into the [Server SDK](/server-sdk), which handles the rest):
1. type of the credential
2. identifier for the person 
3. data about the person

The data schema must match the corresponding credential type. Information on the data formats for each type can be found in the [Data Schema](/schema) section.

```json
{
    "id": "d09ce4f8-6651-406b-a4e5-e4989b7f5254",
    // highlight-start
    "type": "SsnCredential", // the type of credential
    // highlight-end
    "userIdentifier": "test@unumid.abcde",
    "issuanceDate": "1673552399458",
    "expirationDate": "1701483024054",
    // highlight-start
    // the data attribute must match the SsnCredential JSON schema properties as mentioned in the Data Schema section.
    // i.e. https://schema.unumid.co/jsonSchema/SsnCredential
    "data": {
        "ssn": "111-22-3333"
    }
    // highlight-end
}
```

### Presentation

> A **presentation** is a set of one or more <a href="/terminology#credential"><Tip type="credential">credentials</Tip></a>. It's shared with (or <i>presented</i> to) a company by a user.

**Example:** Richard shares a presentation of a KYC verification credential (which ACME Bank issued to him) with Hooli FinTech.

**Components:** Upon a user agreeing to share (or <i>present</i>) a presentation using the <a href="/web-wallet">Unum ID Web Wallet</a> the generated presentation uuid is passed back to the referring customer client and presentation object is securely stored for retrieval in the Unum ID cloud. The uuid is used to GET the presentation the customer created with the requested data.

A user always shares a presentation in response to a <Tip type="request"/>.

:::note
A presentation's credential data is stored securely via a data privacy vault that encrypts and tokenizes the data. The data is only retrieved and decrypted for the brand that matches whom the presentation was created for and agreed to share with by the user.
:::

```json
{
    // highlight-start
    "uuid": "36dadccb-5f34-4fe9-82d0-8a9bdbaca1b2", // the presentation uuid used for its retrieval
    // highlight-end
    "createdAt": "1673494220947",
    "updatedAt": "1673494220947",
    // highlight-start
    "brandUuid": "8005c39c-54d7-487e-bf4d-9eb5d39ed795", // this should always match your own ApiKey's brand uuid.
    // highlight-end
    "presentationRequestUuid": "82d0616e-df5a-471a-9029-885e905a3966", // the corresponding presentation request uuid
    "user": {
        "id": "e31de809-ea49-4384-9d3e-6c70d5ff05c7",
        "emailAddresses": ["test@unumid.co"],
        "phoneNumbers": []
    },
    "credentials": [
        // highlight-start
        {
            "id": "8a1d4e35-413d-496b-b499-8810b55cfb5c",
            "issuer": "32ef9562-312d-4a8b-8f3e-ccb8df500b55",
            "type": "EmailCredential",
            "data": {
                "email": "test@unumid.co"
            },
            "issuanceDate": "1671847264479",
            "expirationDate": "1871839024044",
        }
        // highlight-end
    ]
}
```

### Request 

> A **request** (or <i>presentation request</i>) is a request for a <a href="/terminology#presentation"><Tip type="presentation"/></a>. It's created when a company successfully checks if a <Tip type="user"/> has matching credentials, via [/hasMatchingCredentials](/api-overview#check-user-credentials). Only if the user has the ability to response with the requested credential data is a request created.

**Example:** Hooli FinTech checks if Richard has a SSN credential issued by ACME Bank. Because he does a request is created for a presentation of a SSN credential specifically from ACME Bank. This request is to be presented to Richard via Hooli directing to the resultant `url` in the /hasMatchingCredentials response body.

**Components:** A company creates a user specific request by using [/hasMatchingCredentials](/api-overview#check-user-credentials). If it is case the <Tip type="user"/> does not have the desired credentials then a request is not created. If it is the case the user does, a request is created and is returned in the form of a `url` attribute in response to the client. 

The client is then expected to direct to the url, which will be to Unum ID Web Wallet, where the user will be required to authenticate then agree to share the data relevant data.

At a high level, to create a request a company inputs three pieces of information (into the [Server SDK](/server-sdk), which handles the rest):
1. identifier for the company

and a list containing, for each credential:

2. type of the credential
3. acceptable <Tip type="issuer">issuer(s)</Tip> of the credential

If multiple issuer brands are listed, a credential (of the correct type) from any one of them is acceptable. If none, then any issuer of the desired credential type is acceptable.

:::important
The <Tip type="brand"/> of the credential can be *the same company* as the one making the request! For example, a single company issues an authentication credential to a user, who later shares a presentation containing that credential back with the company to authenticate.
:::

The full details of the request object aren't that important or helpful to know as it completely internal to Unum ID, but here's an example of a request for a FirstName and LastName credential from the same issuing brand.

    }
}
```

### User

> A **user** is an individual in the Unum ID network that can share credential data. Each user one or more phone or email associated with them.

:::note
To avoid having to define, query, and share the User "ID", users can be simply referenced by email and/or phone, identifiers that your already have for your own user accounts.
:::

**Example:** Richard is a user in your account system and potentially of the Unum ID network. He has two email addresses and one phone with him. Credentials can be issued to or requested of him using any of these identifiers.

**Components:** Referenced in API endpoints `/hasMatchingCredentials` and `/issueCredentials`. User data is associated by using these user identifiers that you already keep on your users.

```json
{
    "id": "e31de809-ea49-4384-9d3e-6c70d5ff05c7",
    "createdAt": "1671242870669",
    "updatedAt": "1671242870669",
    "emailAddresses": ["test@unumid.co"],
    "phoneNumbers": []
}
