Unum ID uses a few specialized terms and concepts. It's not necessary to understand these in full detail, but knowing a little about them will help you deploy and use Unum ID tech.

:::tip
**We've included helpful tooltips** like <Tip text="Whoa, a tooltip! 😎">this one</Tip> (hover over it) throughout the docs. These offer quick definitions, examples, and links to dive in deeper. Anytime you see an underline, hover over it to see the tooltip!

The tooltips you'll see most often refer to the terms described in this section (for example: <Tip type="credential"/>).
:::

**The [main terms](#main-terms) to know are:**

- **[user](#user)**
- **[credential](#credential)**
- **[presentation](#presentation)**
- **[request](#request)**

## Main Terms

### Credential

> A **credential** is a collection of data about a person. It's issued by a company (i.e. created and sent to a user) and stored in the company's app, on that user's device.

**Example:** ACME Bank issues a KYC verification credential to Richard (an ACME user). This includes Richard's contact information and account numbers, as well as a level of confidence in the accuracy of the data.

**Components:** A company issues credentials using the <a href="/server-sdk">Server SDK</a>, and an app stores credentials using the <a href="/mobile-sdk-overview">Mobile SDK</a>.

At a high level, to issue a credential a company inputs four pieces of information (into the [Server SDK](/server-sdk), which handles the rest):
1. type of the credential
2. identifier for the person 
3. data about the person

The data schema must match the corresponding credential type. Information on the data formats for each type can be found in the [Data Schema](/schema) section.

```json
{
    "id": "d09ce4f8-6651-406b-a4e5-e4989b7f5254",
    // highlight-start
    "type": "SsnCredential", // the type of credential
    // highlight-end
    "userIdentifier": "test@unumid.abcde",
    "issuanceDate": "1673552399458",
    "expirationDate": "1701483024054",
    // highlight-start
    // the data attribute must match the SsnCredential JSON schema properties as mentioned in the Data Schema section.
    // i.e. https://schema.unumid.co/jsonSchema/SsnCredential
    "data": {
        "ssn": "111-22-3333"
    }
    // highlight-end
}
```

### Presentation

> A **presentation** is a set of one or more <a href="/terminology#credential"><Tip type="credential">credentials</Tip></a>. It's shared with (or <i>presented</i> to) a company by a user.

**Example:** Richard shares a presentation of a KYC verification credential (which ACME Bank issued to him) with Hooli FinTech.

**Components:** A user's app shares (or <i>presents</i>) presentations using the <a href="/mobile-sdk-overview">Mobile SDK</a>, and a company verifies presentations using the <a href="/server-sdk">Server SDK</a>.

A user typically (but not always) shares a presentation in response to a <Tip type="request"/>. The user's app first asks them if they want to share the requested information. Then, if the user chooses to share, the app prompts them to pass a biometric/passcode check. If the user passes that check, the app creates a presentation and sends it.

The presentation is cryptographically signed with the user's private key. This makes it possible to later check that the presentation is valid and was created by the user's app, on their device.

:::note
Each credential within the presentation is *itself* cryptographically signed but with the private key of the company that issued it. So, for example, a presentation of three credentials has four total signatures: one on each credential and one on the whole presentation.
:::

The full details of the presentation object aren't that important or helpful to know, but here's an example:

```json

    "@context": ["https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1"],
    "type": ["VerifiablePresentation"],
    // credentials contained in presentation, in this case just one
    // highlight-start
    "verifiableCredential": [

        "proofPurpose": "assertionMethod"
    }
    // highlight-end
}
```

### Request 

> A **request** (or <i>presentation request</i>) is a request for a <a href="/terminology#presentation"><Tip type="presentation"/></a>. It's sent by a company to a user, who chooses whether to share a presentation in response.

**Example:** Hooli FinTech sends Richard a request for (a presentation of) a KYC verification credential from ACME Bank.

**Components:** A company creates requests using the <a href="/server-sdk">Server SDK</a> and routes them to users using the <a href="/web-sdk">Web SDK</a>. A user's app responds to requests using the <a href="/mobile-sdk-overview">Mobile SDK</a>.

At a high level, to create a request a company inputs three pieces of information (into the [Server SDK](/server-sdk), which handles the rest):
1. identifier for the company

and a list containing, for each credential:

2. type of the credential
3. acceptable <Tip type="issuer">issuer(s)</Tip> of the credential

If multiple issuers are listed, a credential (of the correct type) from any one of them is acceptable.

:::important
The <Tip type="issuer"/> of the credential can be *the same company* as the one making the request (the <Tip type="verifier"/>)! This is the case for our [Passwordless Auth](https://www.unumid.co/solutions/passwordless-auth) product. A single company issues an authentication credential to a user, who later shares a presentation containing that credential back with the company to authenticate.
:::

The request is cryptographically signed with the company's private key. This makes it possible to later check that the request is valid and was created by that company, which helps prevent attacks like phishing.

### User

> A **user** is an individual in the Unum ID network that can share credential data. Each user one or more phone or email associated with them.

:::note
To avoid having to defined a shared User "ID", users can be referenced by email and/or phone, identifiers that your already have for your own user accounts.
:::

**Example:** Richard is a user in your account system and potentially of the Unum ID network. He has two email addresses and one phone with him. Credentials can be issued to or requested of him using any of these identifiers.

**Components:** Referenced in API endpoints `/hasMatchingCredentials` and `/issueCredentials`. User data is associated by using these user identifiers that you already keep on your users.
