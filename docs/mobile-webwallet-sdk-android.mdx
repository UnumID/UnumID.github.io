*Docs for the iOS WebWallet SDK are [here](mobile-webwallet-sdk-ios).*

This is a lightweight, fully native SDK that allows a host app to perform web wallet authentication and verification of a user. It works with both Kotlin and Java native apps.

:::note
An example project using this SDK can be found [here](https://github.com/UnumID/UnumIdWebAuth-Android/). This serves as a useful technical reference.

## Overview

### Minimum Requirements
- **Android 6.0 (Marshmallow) and above**

### Installation

In the app level build.gradle add the following maven repository:

```groovy

android {
    repositories {
        maven {
            name = "GitHubPackages"
            url = uri("https://maven.pkg.github.com/UnumID/UnumIDWebWallet-android")
        }
    }

   ......
```

In the app level build.gradle add the reference to the SDK

```groovy
implementation "id.unum:verified-android:(insert latest version)"
```

### Activating a user

When a host application would like to activate a user with the UnumID Web Wallet Verification SDK, then the 'launchActivate' method will be called. An `IssueCredentialsRequest` object will also need to be provided to the endpoint. This will let the SDK know what credentials should be assigned to the user being activated.

``` kotlin
/**
     * Method called to launch the activate dialog flow.
     * @param issueCredentialsRequest - credential request
     * @param brand - The name of the client brand
     * @param callback - callback to be called once the dialog is closed
     */
    fun launchActivate(
        issueCredentialsRequest: IssueCredentialsRequest,
        brand: String,
        callback: UnumDialogComplete
    )
```

### Has Matching Credentials

The host application can check to see if a user has existing credentials already associated with the UnumID SDK. To do this, call the `hasMatchingCredentials` function. If there are matching credentials, the response will contain a url that can then be passed to the `launchVerify` function.

```kotlin
/**
     * Method called to check if there are matching credentials for the given email and phone.
     * @param brand - The name of the client brand
     * @param showDialog - if a dialog should be shown to the user
     * @param callback - callback results
     * @param request - api request body
     */
    fun hasMatchingCredentials(
        brand: String,
        showDialog: Boolean,
        callback: UnumDialogComplete,
        request: HasMatchingCredentialsRequest,
    )
```


### Verifying a user

When the host application would like to verify a user, then the following function can be called.

``` kotlin
/**
     * Method called to launch the Verification View.
     * @param url - url to be loaded
     * @param brand - The name of the client brand
     * @param callback - callback to be called once the dialog is closed
     * @param showDialog - whether to show the preliminary dialog or not
     */
    fun launchVerify(
        url: String,
        brand: String,
        callback: UnumDialogComplete,
        showDialog: Boolean = false // default value
    )
```
