**[Unum ID](https://www.unumid.co) is the Verified Network.** We provide a marketplace for verified identity data, shared with full user consent. You can use Unum ID for:
- **[1-Click or Free ID Verification](https://www.unumid.co/1-click):** Either it's 1-click, or it's on us. 
    - If a user has a digital ID card, they can verify with 1-click â€” instant onboarding.
    - Otherwise, the user completes your existing ID verification process, and we cover the cost.

You can also offer digital ID cards to your existing users. We'll reimburse you for each card you issue.
