**[Unum ID](https://www.Unum.ID) is the sharified identityâ„¢ network.** Our tech allows companies to securely access and share verified identity data, with full user consent. You can use Unum ID to enable:
- **[One-Click or Free IDV](https://www.unumid.co/solutions/sharified-identity):** A marketplace for verified identity data, enabling instant onboarding and more. Data recipients pay data providers for access. If the necessary data is not avaiable for the user in question we'll pay your KYC costs if you issue a credential in our network.
