**[Unum ID](https://www.Unum.ID) is the sharified identityâ„¢ network.** Our tech allows companies to securely access and share verified identity data, with full user consent. You can use Unum ID to enable:
- **[Passwordless Auth](https://www.unumid.co/solutions/passwordless-auth):** Instant multi-factor authentication, using your mobile app. No passwords or other shared secrets! (This is Unum ID *within* your company.)
- **[Sharified Identity](https://www.unumid.co/solutions/sharified-identity):** A marketplace for verified identity data, enabling instant onboarding and more. Data recipients pay data providers for access. (This is Unum ID *across* multiple companies.)
