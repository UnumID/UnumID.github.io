Unum ID is the sharified identity™ network. You can use our software 
within your organization to enable use cases like passwordless auth. 
And you can use it with other organizations to securely share verified 
identity data with user consent and in full compliance. This enables 
instant onboarding to new services and opens up new revenue 
opportunities for organizations providing the data.

The magic of Unum ID, and what distinguishes it from other identity 
solutions, is that each user’s data is stored in their own app, and 
*only* you and that specific user ever have access to it. ​**We 
coordinate sharing of data without ever being able to interact with 
it in plaintext.** ​This provides unparalleled security and privacy. 
It’s a solution optimized for a world of GDPR, constant data breaches, 
and decreasing user trust. See [Security​](/security) for more information.
