**[Unum ID](https://www.unumid.co) is the Verified Network.** We provide a marketplace for verified identity data, shared with full user consent. You can use Unum ID for:
- **[1-Click or Free ID Verification](https://www.unumid.co/1-click):** Either it's 1-click, or it's on us. 
    - If a user has a digital ID card, they can verify with 1-click â€” instant onboarding.
    - Otherwise, the user completes your existing ID verification process, and we cover the cost.
- **Custom Digital ID Cards:** We'll pay you for each card you issue. 
    - You can offer digital ID cards to your users the next time they log in to your service, through marketing emails, or through in-app offers. 
    - In each case, it takes just one API call.
