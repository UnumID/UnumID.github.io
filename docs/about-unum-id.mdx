**[Unum ID](https://www.unumid.co) is the sharified identityâ„¢ network.** Our tech allows companies to securely access and share verified identity data, with full user consent. You can use Unum ID to enable:
- **[One-Click or Free IDV](https://www.unumid.co/1-click):** A marketplace for verified identity data, enabling instant onboarding and more. Data recipients pay data providers for access.
